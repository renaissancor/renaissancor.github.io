# Linked List: Reverse Function & Notes Summary

### Date: 2025-04-14

## Overview
This document summarizes the key implementation and conceptual points of a **Doubly Linked List (DLList)**, particularly focusing on the **`reverse()`** function, which was a **Krafton coding test question**. Additional system-level and algorithmic context related to data erasure, sorting, and data structures is also included.

## Core Class: DLList
The `DLList` template manages a doubly linked list with forward and backward traversal. Each node (`tNode`) contains:

- `T m_Data`: Stored data.
- `tNode* m_Next`: Pointer to the next node.
- `tNode* m_Prev`: Pointer to the previous node.

### Important Members:
- `m_Head`: Points to the first node.
- `m_Tail`: Points to the last node.
- `m_Size`: Current size of the list.

## Reverse Function (Krafton Exam Focus)

```cpp
void reverse() {
    reverse(m_Head);
}

void reverse(tNode<T>* _Node) {
    if (nullptr != _Node->m_Next) {
        reverse(_Node->m_Next);
    }

    if (_Node->m_Next == nullptr) {
        tNode<T>* pTemp = m_Head;
        m_Head = m_Tail;
        m_Tail = pTemp;
    }

    tNode<T>* pTemp = _Node->m_Next;
    _Node->m_Next = _Node->m_Prev;
    _Node->m_Prev = pTemp;
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Recursive approach**.
- **Base case** is the last node (`_Node->m_Next == nullptr`).
- Upon reaching the last node, `m_Head` and `m_Tail` are swapped.
- Pointers are reversed for every node recursively.

## Technical Notes

### 0-based vs 1-based data
- Systems may index starting at 0 or 1. Pay attention in competitive programming and interviews.

### Forensic Data Removal
- **Header-only deletion** means the actual data remains on disk.
- Overwriting with high-volume data ensures old content becomes unrecoverable.

### `friend class` Usage
- Enables mutual access between internal iterator classes and their containers.
- Example: `friend class DLList;` inside `iterator`.

## CArray Context & Erase Function (For Comparison)

```cpp
template<typename T>
typename CArray<T>::iterator CArray<T>::erase(iterator& _TargetIter) {
    assert(this == _TargetIter.m_Owner
        && _TargetIter.m_Idx < m_CurSize
        && _TargetIter.m_Idx != -1);

    iterator NextIter(this, _TargetIter.m_Idx);

    int MoveCount = m_CurSize - (_TargetIter.m_Idx + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < MoveCount; ++i) {
        m_Data[_TargetIter.m_Idx + i] = m_Data[_TargetIter.m_Idx + i + 1];
    }

    return end();
}
```

This shows how iterator logic and range assertions ensure safe array element erasure.

## Additional Notes

### Search Algorithms:
- **Linear search:** O(n)
- **Binary search:** O(log n) â€“ requires sorted data

### Graph Algorithms:
- Handle **data relationships**.
- Useful for managing relational information (e.g., social networks, recommendation systems).

### Sorting Algorithms:
- **Stable sort:** Maintains order of equal elements
- **Unstable sort:** Does not guarantee order

### Trees:
- Represent layered structures like organizational charts or family trees.
- BSTs are optimized for fast searching.
