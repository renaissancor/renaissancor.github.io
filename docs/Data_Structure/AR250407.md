# Dynamic Memory Management and Template Usage

### Date: 2025-04-07

## Key Points

- The `new` operator is used for dynamic memory allocation in C++, replacing C's `malloc`.
- **Dynamic allocation** using `new` calls constructors and `delete` calls destructors automatically.
- Templates enable type-safe dynamic memory management.
- The **Rule of Three/Five**: Define destructors, copy constructors, and assignment operators for resource management.
- Using `assert` in C++ helps verify conditions during debugging.

## Overview

C++ offers powerful ways to manage dynamic memory using `new` and `delete` operators. These operators manage memory on the heap, which is essential for objects that need to persist beyond their scope or be shared between different parts of the program. Along with dynamic memory, C++ supports templates, which allow you to create generic classes and functions that work with any data type.

Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation are central concepts in C++, and understanding these is crucial for managing resources efficiently. This section will also explore **containers** like `vector` and `list` for handling collections of data.

## C++ Dynamic Memory Management

### Basic Dynamic Allocation

In C++, dynamic memory is allocated using the `new` keyword, which initializes objects and arrays on the heap. Unlike the `malloc` function in C, `new` calls constructors and handles memory initialization automatically.

```cpp
// Allocating a single object dynamically using new
MyClass* pNewMy = new MyClass;

// Deallocating memory using delete
delete pNewMy;

// Allocating an array dynamically
MyClass* pMyArr = new MyClass[10];

// Deallocating an array using delete[]
delete[] pMyArr;
```

**Important note:** When you use `delete[]`, make sure to use the `[]` as this ensures the array destructor is called properly.

## Templates in C++: `CArray` Example

Templates in C++ allow you to define classes and functions that can operate on any data type. For instance, `CArray` is a custom container that mimics the behavior of a vector:

```cpp
template <typename T>
void CArray<T>::push_back(const T& _Data) {
    // Adds an element to the array (implementation not shown here)
}
```

**Template Constructors:**

The constructor for a template class (e.g., `CArray<t>::CArray()`) initializes the object. This is useful for creating data structures that can handle any type of data.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Mismatched Memory Management

When working with dynamic memory allocation, **matching `new` with `delete`** is essential. Failing to do so can lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior.

```cpp
// Correct way to allocate and deallocate dynamically
MyClass* pMy = new MyClass;
delete pMy;

// Incorrect: Forgetting delete[] for arrays
MyClass* pArr = new MyClass[10];
delete pArr;  // Error: should be delete[] for arrays
```

### 2. Template Function Duplication

Ensure that template functions are correctly specialized or instantiated. Duplicate definitions across files can cause **link errors**.

```cpp
// Duplicate definition of a template function
int Add(int a, int b);  // Declaration
int Add(int a, int b);  // This should cause a link error if defined twice
```

### 3. Use of `assert`

The `assert` macro is used for debugging purposes, ensuring conditions hold true during runtime.

```cpp
#include <cassert>

assert(m_CurSize > _idx);  // Check that the index is valid

// Example of assert behavior
assert(nullptr);  // This will prompt a failure during debugging
```

## Working with Containers: `vector` vs `list`

### `vector`

A **vector** is a dynamic array that allows **fast indexing** but slower insertions/deletions in the middle of the collection. Its size can be dynamically adjusted, and elements can be accessed quickly.

```cpp
std::vector<int> vecInt;
vecInt.push_back(10);
vecInt.push_back(20);
vecInt.push_back(30);

// Accessing elements
int first = vecInt[0];  // O(1) access time
```

**Capacity and Resizing:**

- **`reserve()`**: Pre-allocates memory to avoid frequent reallocation.
- **`resize()`**: Adjusts the current size and fills with default values.

### `list`

A **list** is a doubly-linked list, which excels at insertion and deletion operations but suffers from slower access times compared to `vector`.

```cpp
std::list<int> intList;
intList.push_back(10);
intList.push_back(20);
intList.push_back(30);

// Iterating through a list using an iterator
for (auto iter = intList.begin(); iter != intList.end(); ++iter) {
    // Do something with *iter
}
```

### Why `list` is Better for Certain Use Cases

- **Insertion and Deletion:** `list` is better when you frequently insert or remove elements in the middle.
- **Accessing by Index:** For indexed access, `vector` is more efficient.

## Interview Questions

**Q: What is the difference between `new` and `malloc`?**  
A: `new` in C++ calls the constructor of the object being allocated, while `malloc` simply allocates memory without initializing it. `new` also throws exceptions in case of failure, while `malloc` returns `nullptr`.

**Q: Why use `delete[]` instead of `delete` when deallocating arrays?**  
A: `delete[]` ensures that the destructors for each element of the array are called properly, while `delete` only calls the destructor for the first element.

## Tricky Case: Using `template` with Custom Containers

```cpp
// Template container example (simplified)
template <typename T>
class CArray {
    T* m_data;
    size_t m_Capacity;

public:
    CArray(size_t capacity = 10) : m_Capacity(capacity) {
        m_data = new T[m_Capacity];
    }

    ~CArray() {
        delete[] m_data;
    }

    void push_back(const T& _Data);
};
```

**Note:** When using templates, ensure that memory management is done properly, especially when handling raw pointers and dynamic arrays inside a template class.

## Code Demonstration

```cpp
int* pArr = new int[5];  // Dynamically allocate an array

// Fill the array
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    pArr[i] = i * 10;
}

// Output array
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    std::cout << pArr[i] << " ";
}

// Deallocate memory
delete[] pArr;
```

## Visual: Ownership Transfer with `new` and `delete`

```
Before Deletion             After Deletion
------------                -------------
Object A                    Object A
[data -> 0x1234]            [data -> nullptr]

Object B                    Object B
[data -> nullptr]           [data -> 0x1234]
```
