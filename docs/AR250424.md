- Virtual functions enable runtime binding of function calls to the correct implementation
- The `override` keyword ensures correct method overriding in derived classes
- Pure virtual functions and abstract classes define interfaces that derived classes must implement
- Const member functions guarantee they won't modify object state
- Static variables and functions provide class-wide storage and functionality
- Static member variables are shared across all instances of a class

## Polymorphism and Virtual Functions

Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming that allows us to treat objects of derived classes as objects of a base class. This enables writing more flexible and maintainable code, especially in game development where entity hierarchies are common.

### The Basics of Polymorphism

Polymorphism in C++ depends on three key elements:
1. Inheritance 
2. Pointers/references to base classes
3. Virtual functions

```cpp
class Parent {
public:
    virtual void Move() {
        std::cout << "!!Parent Move!!" << std::endl;
    }
    
    virtual void Test() {
        std::cout << "!!Parent Test!!" << std::endl;
    }
    
    // Pure virtual function
    virtual void Fly() = 0;
};

class Child : public Parent {
private:
    short m_S;
    
public:
    virtual void Move() override {
        std::cout << "!!Child Move!!" << std::endl;
    }
    
    virtual void SetShort(short _Short) {
        m_S = _Short;
    }
};
```

A key property of polymorphism is that a parent class pointer can point to a child class object, but not vice versa:

```cpp
Parent* pParent = &C;  // Valid: Parent pointer can point to Child object
// Child* pChild = &P;  // Invalid: Child pointer cannot point to Parent object
```

This is because a parent pointer can only access the parent's portion of the child object. Since every child object contains a complete parent object as its first portion, a parent pointer can safely point to a child object.

### Virtual Function Mechanism

Without virtual functions, a significant issue arises: when calling a method through a base class pointer, the compiler would always call the base class version of the method, regardless of the actual object type. This is called static binding.

Virtual functions solve this problem by implementing dynamic binding (runtime binding). When a function is declared as `virtual`, the compiler creates a special mechanism that determines the correct function to call based on the actual object type at runtime.

```cpp
Parent P;
Child C;
Parent* pParent;

pParent = &P;
pParent->Move();  // Calls Parent::Move()

pParent = &C;
pParent->Move();  // Calls Child::Move() because of virtual function mechanism
```

### Virtual Function Table (VTable)

When a class has virtual functions, the compiler creates a hidden structure called a virtual function table (VTable) for that class. Each class with virtual functions gets its own VTable containing function pointers to its virtual methods.

Additionally, every object of a class with virtual functions contains a hidden pointer (often called `__vfptr` or virtual function table pointer) that points to the VTable for its class.

During runtime, when a virtual function is called through a base class pointer, the system:
1. Accesses the object's `__vfptr` to locate its VTable
2. Looks up the appropriate function pointer in the VTable
3. Calls the function corresponding to the actual object type

This behind-the-scenes mechanism enables polymorphic behavior where the correct version of an overridden function is called based on the actual object type.

### The Override Keyword

The `override` keyword, introduced in C++11, helps prevent errors by explicitly declaring that a function is intended to override a virtual function from a base class:

```cpp
virtual void Move() override {
    std::cout << "!!Child Move!!" << std::endl;
}
```

Using `override` provides two key benefits:
1. It clearly communicates intent to readers of the code
2. The compiler will generate an error if the function doesn't actually override a virtual function from the base class

While `override` is technically optional, using it is considered a best practice that helps catch errors early.

## Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes

### Pure Virtual Functions

A pure virtual function is a virtual function that has no implementation in the base class and must be implemented by any concrete derived class:

```cpp
// Pure virtual function declaration
virtual void Fly() = 0;
```

The `= 0` syntax marks a function as pure virtual, indicating:
1. The function has no implementation in this class
2. Derived classes must provide an implementation (unless they also want to be abstract)
3. The class containing the pure virtual function cannot be instantiated directly

### Abstract Classes

A class with at least one pure virtual function is called an abstract class. Abstract classes:

- Cannot be instantiated directly
- Serve as interfaces that derived classes must implement
- Define a common interface for a family of classes

Abstract classes are particularly useful in game development for creating entity hierarchies. For example, a `GameObject` abstract class might define pure virtual functions like `Update()` and `Render()` that all game objects must implement.

```cpp
// Abstract class (cannot be instantiated)
class GameObject {
public:
    virtual void Update(float deltaTime) = 0;
    virtual void Render() = 0;
    virtual ~GameObject() {}
};

// Concrete class (can be instantiated)
class Player : public GameObject {
public:
    void Update(float deltaTime) override {
        // Implementation
    }
    
    void Render() override {
        // Implementation
    }
};
```

If a derived class doesn't implement all pure virtual functions from its base class, it remains abstract and cannot be instantiated.

---

## Const Member Variables and Functions

### Const Member Variables

Const member variables are variables whose values cannot be changed after initialization. They must be initialized in the constructor's initializer list, as they cannot be assigned values in the constructor body:

```cpp
class CMyClass {
private:
    int m_i;
    const char m_C;

public:
    CMyClass()
        : m_i(0)
        , m_C(100)  // Const member must be initialized here
    {
        m_i = 10;   // This is fine
        // m_C = 200;  // ERROR: Cannot modify const member
    }
};
```

Const member variables help enforce immutability within a class and catch potential errors at compile time.

### Const Member Functions

A const member function is a function that guarantees it won't modify the state of the object on which it's called. These functions are declared with the `const` keyword after the parameter list:

```cpp
class CMyClass {
private:
    int m_i;
    const char m_C;

public:
    void SetIntData(int _Data) {
        m_i = _Data;  // Modifies the object
    }

    // Const member function guarantees it won't modify the object
    int GetIntData() const {
        return m_i;
        // m_i = 100;  // ERROR: Cannot modify member in const function
    }

    char GetCharData() const {
        return m_C;
    }
};
```

Const member functions are important for:
1. Documenting and enforcing which functions don't modify the object
2. Allowing functions to be called on const objects
3. Preventing accidental modifications

### Const Pointers to Objects

When using a const pointer to an object, only const member functions can be called on that object:

```cpp
const CMyClass* pMy = &c;
pMy->GetIntData();    // OK: const function can be called
// pMy->SetIntData(100);  // ERROR: non-const function cannot be called on const object
```

This provides another layer of safety by ensuring that objects aren't modified through specific pointers.

## Static Variables and Functions

### Static Variables in Functions

Static variables declared inside a function retain their values between function calls. They're initialized only once when the function is first called and persist for the program's lifetime:

```cpp
int* StaticFunc() {
    static int iStatic = 0;  // Initialized only once, on first function call
    iStatic = 100;
    return &iStatic;  // Safe to return address of static variable
}

int main() {
    int* pStatic = StaticFunc();  // iStatic becomes 100
    *pStatic = 300;               // Modifies iStatic to 300
    StaticFunc();                 // Returns the address of iStatic (still 300)
}
```

Static variables in functions are stored in the data segment of memory rather than the stack, making them accessible throughout the program's lifetime.

### Static Global Variables

When a global variable is declared as static, its scope is limited to the file in which it's declared:

```cpp
// In file1.cpp
static int g_static = 0;  // Only accessible within file1.cpp

// In file2.cpp
static int g_static = 10;  // Different variable, only accessible within file2.cpp
```

This file-level encapsulation helps prevent naming conflicts between different source files.

### Static Member Variables

Static member variables belong to the class itself, not to any specific instance:

```cpp
class CTestClass {
public:
    static int m_StaticMember;  // Declaration only
private:
    int m_Member;
    
public:
    CTestClass() : m_Member(0) {
        m_StaticMember = 20;  // Accessible from any instance
    }
};

// Definition required in a source file
int CTestClass::m_StaticMember = 0;
```

Key characteristics of static member variables:
1. Only one copy exists for the entire class, shared among all instances
2. They must be defined outside the class definition (typically in a .cpp file)
3. They're not part of the object's memory layout
4. They follow the class's access control rules (private, protected, public)

```cpp
int main() {
    CTestClass inst;
    CTestClass inst1;
    CTestClass inst2;
    
    inst.m_StaticMember = 10;    // All instances share the same static member
    inst1.m_StaticMember = 20;   // Changes the value for all instances
    inst2.m_StaticMember = 30;   // Changes the value for all instances
    
    CTestClass::m_StaticMember = 40;  // Can access without an instance if public
}
```

### Static Member Functions

Static member functions belong to the class itself, not to any specific instance. They can be called without creating an object:

```cpp
class CTest {
private:
    static int m_Static;
    int m_i;

public:
    void SetData(int _Data) {
        this->m_i = _Data;    // Can access instance members
        m_Static = 20;        // Can access static members
    }
    
    // Static member function - no 'this' pointer
    static void StaticFunc() {
        m_Static = 100;       // Can access static members
        // m_i = 10;          // ERROR: Cannot access instance members
    }
};

int CTest::m_Static = 0;  // Definition required in a source file

int main() {
    CTest::StaticFunc();  // Call without creating an object
    
    CTest t1;
    t1.StaticFunc();      // Can also call through an instance, but discouraged
}
```

Key characteristics of static member functions:
1. They don't have a `this` pointer
2. They cannot access non-static member variables or call non-static member functions
3. They can access static member variables, including private ones
4. They can be called without creating an instance of the class

### Static Member Functions vs. Global Functions

Static member functions differ from global functions in several ways:
1. Static member functions are part of the class's scope and can access its private static members
2. They provide namespace functionality while maintaining the class's access control
3. They make the code more organized by grouping class-related functionality

```cpp
// Global function cannot access private static members
void GlobalFunc() {
    // CTest::m_Static = 100;  // ERROR: Cannot access private member
}
```

## Visual: Memory Layout

```
Instance Variables vs. Static Variables
--------------------------------------

Class CTest {
    static int m_Static;  // One copy in data segment
    int m_i;             // One copy per instance
};

Memory Layout:
-------------
Data Segment:         Heap/Stack:
+------------+        +-----------+
| m_Static=0 |        | Object t1 |
+------------+        | m_i=100   |
                      +-----------+
                      | Object t2 |
                      | m_i=200   |
                      +-----------+
                      | Object t3 |
                      | m_i=300   |
                      +-----------+

When static member is modified:
CTest::m_Static = 50;

Updated Memory:
-------------
Data Segment:         Heap/Stack:
+------------+        +-----------+
| m_Static=50|        | Object t1 |
+------------+        | m_i=100   |
                      +-----------+
                      | Object t2 |
                      | m_i=200   |
                      +-----------+
                      | Object t3 |
                      | m_i=300   |
                      +-----------+
```

## Tricky Case: Virtual Function Tables

One of the trickiest aspects of virtual functions is understanding how they affect object size and memory layout. Consider:

```cpp
class Parent {
    float m_P;
public:
    virtual void Move();
};

class Child : public Parent {
    short m_S;
public:
    virtual void Move() override;
};
```

The `sizeof(Parent)` will be greater than just the size of a `float` because the compiler adds a hidden virtual function table pointer (`__vfptr`). Similarly, the size of `Child` includes the `Parent` part, the `short` member, and potentially its own virtual function information.

When a parent class pointer points to a child object, the virtual function mechanism allows the correct overridden function to be called:

```cpp
Parent* pParent = &childObject;
pParent->Move();  // Calls Child::Move(), not Parent::Move()
```

---

## Common Mistakes

### Forgetting to Mark Overridden Functions as Virtual

If a base class function isn't marked as `virtual`, derived classes can still redefine it, but polymorphism won't work:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    void NonVirtualFunc() { /* ... */ }  // Not virtual
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void NonVirtualFunc() { /* ... */ }  // Redefines but doesn't override
};

// Later:
Base* ptr = new Derived();
ptr->NonVirtualFunc();  // Calls Base::NonVirtualFunc(), not Derived::NonVirtualFunc()
```

### Not Understanding When Objects Are Sliced

When a derived class object is assigned to a base class object (not a pointer or reference), the derived part is "sliced off":

```cpp
Child childObj;
Parent parentObj = childObj;  // Object slicing: derived parts are lost
parentObj.Move();  // Always calls Parent::Move()
```

### Misusing Static Member Variables

A common mistake is treating static member variables as if they belonged to individual instances:

```cpp
CTest::m_Static = 0;
CTest t1, t2;

t1.SetData(100);  // Sets m_Static to 20
t2.SetData(200);  // Sets m_Static to 20 again

// Now m_Static is 20 for ALL instances, not just t2
```

## Interview Questions

**Q: What is the difference between function overloading and function overriding?**  
A: Function overloading refers to defining multiple functions with the same name but different parameters within the same scope. Function overriding happens when a derived class provides a new implementation for a virtual function that was already defined in the base class.

**Q: What happens if a derived class doesn't override all pure virtual functions from its base class?**  
A: The derived class also becomes an abstract class and cannot be instantiated.

**Q: What is the purpose of the `override` keyword?**  
A: The `override` keyword explicitly indicates that a function is intended to override a virtual function from a base class. It helps catch errors at compile time if the function signature doesn't match any virtual function in the base class.

**Q: What's the difference between a static member function and a global function?**  
A: A static member function is part of a class's scope and can access the class's private static members. A global function isn't associated with any class and can only access public members.

**Q: Why must static member variables be defined outside the class definition?**  
A: Static member variables are shared by all instances of a class and must exist even if no instances are created. The class definition only declares the variable, while the definition outside the class allocates memory for it.

**Q: What happens when a const object calls a non-const member function?**  
A: It results in a compile error because non-const member functions don't guarantee they won't modify the object, which violates the const contract.

**Q: How do virtual functions affect the memory layout of an object?**  
A: Classes with virtual functions contain an additional hidden pointer (`__vfptr`) that points to the virtual function table (vtable) for that class. This increases the size of the object.

**Q: What is object slicing and when does it occur?**  
A: Object slicing occurs when a derived class object is assigned to a base class object (not a pointer or reference). Only the base class portion of the derived object is copied, while the derived class-specific members are "sliced off."

**Q: What is the purpose of a pure virtual function?**  
A: Pure virtual functions define an interface that derived classes must implement. They also make the class abstract, preventing direct instantiation.

**Q: How would you implement a singleton pattern using static members?**  
A: A singleton can be implemented using a private static member to hold the single instance, along with a public static function to access it.

## Code Demonstration

### Polymorphism in Action

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Enemy {
public:
    virtual void Attack() {
        std::cout << "Generic enemy attack!" << std::endl;
    }
    
    virtual void TakeDamage(int amount) {
        std::cout << "Enemy takes " << amount << " damage" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Orc : public Enemy {
public:
    void Attack() override {
        std::cout << "Orc swings axe!" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Dragon : public Enemy {
public:
    void Attack() override {
        std::cout << "Dragon breathes fire!" << std::endl;
    }
    
    void TakeDamage(int amount) override {
        std::cout << "Dragon takes " << amount/2 << " damage (50% resistance)" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Game function that works with any Enemy type
void ProcessEnemy(Enemy* enemy) {
    enemy->Attack();
    enemy->TakeDamage(10);
}

int main() {
    Enemy* enemies[3];
    enemies[0] = new Enemy();
    enemies[1] = new Orc();
    enemies[2] = new Dragon();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        ProcessEnemy(enemies[i]);
    }
    
    // Clean up
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        delete enemies[i];
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Generic enemy attack!
Enemy takes 10 damage
Orc swings axe!
Enemy takes 10 damage
Dragon breathes fire!
Dragon takes 5 damage (50% resistance)
```

This demonstrates polymorphism in action with virtual functions being dynamically bound at runtime.

## Modern C++ Considerations

### Using `override` to Catch Errors

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void Function(int x) { /* ... */ }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void Function(float x) override { /* ... */ }  // Compile error: doesn't override base method
    void Function(int x) override { /* ... */ }    // Correct
};
```

### Using `final` to Prevent Further Overriding

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void Function() { /* ... */ }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void Function() override final { /* ... */ }  // Cannot be overridden by further derived classes
};
```

### Smart Pointers and Polymorphism

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Enemy>> enemies;
    
    enemies.push_back(std::make_unique<Enemy>());
    enemies.push_back(std::make_unique<Orc>());
    enemies.push_back(std::make_unique<Dragon>());
    
    for (const auto& enemy : enemies) {
        enemy->Attack();  // Polymorphic call
    }
    
    // No manual cleanup needed - unique_ptr handles deletion
    return 0;
}
```

Remember that a solid understanding of these C++ concepts is essential for game programming interviews. The ability to explain how polymorphism works, when to use static members, and how to properly implement const correctness demonstrates a deep understanding of the language and can set you apart as a candidate.
