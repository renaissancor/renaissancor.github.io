# Function Call, Loops 

## while loop, for loop, do while 

**Infinite `while` loop**

```
     9:     while (1)
00C815DB B8 01 00 00 00       mov         eax,1  
00C815E0 85 C0                test        eax,eax  
00C815E2 74 0B                je          main+2Fh (0C815EFh)  
    10:     {
    11:         ++i; 
00C815E4 8B 45 FC             mov         eax,dword ptr [i]  
00C815E7 83 C0 01             add         eax,1  
00C815EA 89 45 FC             mov         dword ptr [i],eax  
    12:     }
00C815ED EB EC                jmp         main+1Bh (0C815DBh)  
    13: 
    14:     return 0; 
00C815EF 33 C0                xor         eax,eax  
```

Infinite while loop operates like this. Locate function table 
after return table and do comparison in `00C815EF`. 

**Infinite `for` loop** 

```
     9:     for (; ;) {
    10:         ++i; 
008915DB 8B 45 FC             mov         eax,dword ptr [i]  
008915DE 83 C0 01             add         eax,1  
008915E1 89 45 FC             mov         dword ptr [i],eax  
    11:     }
008915E4 EB F5                jmp         main+1Bh (08915DBh)  
```

Infinite for loop IP (Instruction Pointer) continously jump to the upper code 
and repeat it. 

### Usage of `do {} while (0)` in MACRO function  

**Macro Function** declaration often requires `do while` functions to 
operate properly like macro function. Suppose `MACRO` function like this. 

```cpp
#define SHOW(V) 		\
{					    \
	int x = V; 			\
	x += 10; 			\
	printf("%d", x); 	\
} 
```
However, this might not work properly in this kind of MACRO function call. 

```cpp
int x = 0; 
if(x == 0) SHOW(10);
else SHOW(20); // ERROR 
```

Because this operates same as the following. 

```cpp
if(x == 0) {					    
	int x = V; 			
	x += 10; 			
	printf("%d", x); 	
}; // Terminate if else by semicolon  
else { /*skip*/ }; // else without if now 
```

This will terminate the `if else` logic, so that original 
`else` is not working properly. To prevent this, semicolon should be used in 
terminator only, like this. 

```cpp
int x = 0; 
if(x == 0) SHOW(10)
else SHOW(20) // ERROR 
```

However, using C++ function without C++ is very ridiculous and confusing, 
even though it is MACRO function that works properly. Thus, to use 
`MACRO` function with semicolon properly, `do {} while(0)` is often used. 

```cpp
#define SHOW(V) 		\
do {					\
	int x = V; 			\
	x += 10; 			\
	printf("%d", x); 	\
} while (0) 
```

So that `MACRO` function is always properly used with semicolon. 

### Usage of `do {} while (0)` to finish function full of `if else`. 

In Game Server, there might be severals checks in game server programming like this. 

```cpp
void Test() 
{
    int x = 12; 
    if(x != 0) { /*logic*/ }
    if(x != 0) { /*logic*/ }
    if(x != 0) { /*logic*/ }
}
```

These kinds of checks are common to determine input security and prevent errors.  
From Login to a lot of check and confirmation, if anything is wrong 
comparison should stop and function should terminate. 
Actually, in assembly level, `GOTO` usage is okay, unlike public expectation. 

However, as a junior programmer, if you use `GOTO` then senior engineers 
will probably think you are not good. So, `do while` is also useful. 

```cpp
void Test() 
{
    int x = 12; 
    do {
        if(x != 1) { /*logic*/ break; }
        if(x != 2) { /*logic*/ break; }
        if(x != 3) { /*logic*/ break; }
    } while (0); 
}
```

Actually in assembly language `do while` works same as `GOTO`. 
Some might suggest usage of `try catch` instead of `do while`. 
However, `try catch` is used for exeptional, serious cases that OS should intervene. 
It is not for game logic, but for very exceptional system programming case. 
Thus, do not use try catch throw logic. 

## Function Call Debug vs Release 

Function call disassembly, when function call happens. 
In Debug Mode, function call moves instruction pointer by two steps. 

```txt
00AD12EE E9 DD 06 00 00       jmp         test (0AD19D0h)  
...
00AD215A E8 8F F1 FF FF       call        test (0AD12EEh)  
... 
00AD19D0 55                   push        ebp  
```

So basically IP moves twice. Why? 

Function calls A B C D while other function calls E F. 
Compiler compile unit is function unit based. 

Function call address input, and address is not yet arrived in compile stage. 
This is done in linker. 

However, in release mode, instruction pointer moves directly to the function pointer. 

```txt 
00AD215A E8 8F F1 FF FF       call        test (0AD19D0h)  
... 
00AD19D0 55                   push        ebp  
``` 

So, why Debug mode is working like this? 

Suppose there are functions A B C D ... several functions. 
Then function B() is edited, so that its size get changed. 

If `call (address)` address value is directly connected to the address of B. 
It means, in Code section of the entire memory, all `address` values of not only 
function B but also several other functions should be rewritten, since 
function B size change will overwrite significant part of section. 

Moreover, if B function or other functions A C D that have their address changed 
due to rewritting B function is called like hundreds or thousands of times, 
then entire hundreds or thousands of function addresses in code section should 
be rewritten completely again, and linking of function will be completely 
reexecuted again. 

In Debug process, modification of functions is very common. So, reducing debug 
compile time is recommended. Thus, usage of some space for linking convenience 
is recommended like below. 

```
A jmp 
B jmp 
C jmp 
``` 

So, when function A is called thousands of times, and function A is edited, then 
there would be nearly nothing to change, since A jmp that address only will be changed. 
So, Linking process will be quicker in this method rather than rewriting function 
call pointer values for all function A calls hundreds of times.
However, in Release build this method is not used for faster performance. 

## Function Call Stack Procedure 

When function call happens with parameters a b c d, then the stack input order 
will be R to L, aka right to left. 
Assembly language after function parameter call is following. 

```txt 
     5: static int __cdecl test(int a, int b, int c)
00A319D0 55                   push        ebp  
00A319D1 8B EC                mov         ebp,esp  
00A319D3 83 EC 50             sub         esp,50h  // x y z, 0Ah for Release Mode 
00A319D6 53                   push        ebx  
00A319D7 56                   push        esi  
00A319D8 57                   push        edi  
    ... 
     7: 	volatile int ans = 0; 
00A319E4 C7 45 FC 00 00 00 00 mov         dword ptr [ebp-4],0  // ans 
     8:     
     9:     volatile int x = a; 
00A319EB 8B 45 08             mov         eax,dword ptr [ebp+8]   // a
00A319EE 89 45 F8             mov         dword ptr [ebp-8],eax   // x
    10: 	volatile int y = b;
00A319F1 8B 45 0C             mov         eax,dword ptr [ebp+0Ch] // b 
00A319F4 89 45 F4             mov         dword ptr [ebp-0Ch],eax // y
    11: 	volatile int z = c;
00A319F7 8B 45 10             mov         eax,dword ptr [ebp+10h] // c
00A319FA 89 45 F0             mov         dword ptr [ebp-10h],eax // z 
```

Based on assembly, inside of the stack structure will be following. 

```txt
LOW  ADDRESS
|-------------------|
|     Saved EDI     |  <-- (After push edi, this is at esp. Before ret, esp moves here)
|-------------------|
|     Saved ESI     |
|-------------------|
|     Saved EBX     |
|-------------------|
|     (Padding/     |  <-- Remaining local var space from sub esp, 50h
|   Other Locals)   |
|-------------------|
|         z         |  <-- ebp - 16 (0x10) (Matches [ebp-10h])
|-------------------|
|         y         |  <-- ebp - 12 (0x0C) (Matches [ebp-0Ch])
|-------------------|
|         x         |  <-- ebp - 8  (0x08) (Matches [ebp-8])
|-------------------|
|        ans        |  <-- ebp - 4  (0x04) (Matches [ebp-4])
|-------------------|
|    Old EBP        |  <-- **ebp register points here** (after `mov ebp, esp`)
|-------------------|
|    Return Address |  <-- ebp + 4 (Pushed by `call` instruction)
|-------------------|
|    Parameter 'a'  |  <-- ebp + 8
|-------------------|
|    Parameter 'b'  |  <-- ebp + 12 (0x0C)
|-------------------|
|    Parameter 'c'  |  <-- ebp + 16 (0x10)
|-------------------|
|    Caller's       |
|    Stack Frame    |
|-------------------|
HIGH ADDRESS
```

Now after function execution, stack frame should get back into original function. 

```
    25:     return 0; 
00A33337 5F                   pop         edi  
00A33338 5E                   pop         esi  
00A33339 5B                   pop         ebx  
00A3333A 8B E5                mov         esp,ebp  
00A3333C 5D                   pop         ebp  
00A3333D C3                   ret  
```

Before `ret` is called, `ebp` register will save old `ebp` register value 
saved before stack frame of function (`test` function here). Now, before `ret`, 
stack size will get resetted. When `ret` is called during function, 

1. `ret` pops the value currently pointed to by esp 
2. `ret` loads this popped value into the Instruction Pointer

`ebp` register itself will never contain return address. Now, old `ebp` value 
saved in stack, will get popped out by `ret` and it will get back to caller 
`ebp`, in here `main` function `ebp`. 

## Function Calling Convention `__cdecl` vs `__stdcall`. 

x86 Architecture function call convention. 

Suppose you call function with parameters like `void Test(int a, int b, int c, int d)`. 
Then, how does these parameters `a, b, c, d` are going to get transferred? 


In default, our functions follow `__cdecl` convention. This calling convention 
is going to manage parameter stack pointer in caller side. 

```
    30: 	volatile int result = test(a, b, c, d); 
00BC3340 8B 45 F0             mov         eax,dword ptr [d]  
         ... 
00BC334C 8B 45 FC             mov         eax,dword ptr [a]  
00BC334F 50                   push        eax  
00BC3350 E8 7B E6 FF FF       call        test (0BC19D0h)  
00BC3355 83 C4 10             add         esp,10h  
00BC3358 89 45 EC             mov         dword ptr [result],eax  
```

This is function caller part, and it is possible to see that 
`add esp, 10h` actually adds stack pointer 16, parameter space 
after function `call test` is done. 

```
     5: static int __cdecl test(int a, int b, int c, int d)
        ... 
    20: 	return ans; 
00BC1A17 8B 45 FC             mov         eax,dword ptr [ans]  
00BC1A1A 5F                   pop         edi  
00BC1A1B 5E                   pop         esi  
00BC1A1C 5B                   pop         ebx  
00BC1A1D 8B E5                mov         esp,ebp  
00BC1A1F 5D                   pop         ebp  
00BC1A20 C3                   ret  
```

It is possible to see that `ret` value does not return anything. 

On the other hand, `__stdcall` convention will manage parameter in callee side. 
In this calling convention, 

```
    30: 	volatile int result = test(a, b, c, d); 
00BC3340 8B 45 F0             mov         eax,dword ptr [d]  
         ... 
00BC334C 8B 45 FC             mov         eax,dword ptr [a]  
00BC334F 50                   push        eax  
00BC3350 E8 7B E6 FF FF       call        test (0BC19D0h)  
00BC3358 89 45 EC             mov         dword ptr [result],eax  
```

After call, parameter space memory is not handled on the caller side. 

```
return ans; 
00641A1A 5F                   pop         edi  
00641A1B 5E                   pop         esi  
00641A1C 5B                   pop         ebx  
00641A1D 8B E5                mov         esp,ebp  
00641A1F 5D                   pop         ebp  
00641A20 C2 10 00             ret         10h 
```

It is possible to see that `ret 10h`, assembly command `ret` has parameter 16, 
space assigned for 4 integers a b c d for input.
