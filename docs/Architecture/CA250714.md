## `volatile` 는 최적화 컴파일 안 하겠다 

multithreading logic includes other function logics 
implied but compiler do not understand this. 

Optimal compile mess up the code 

Server debugging 

different compared to client 

First step for server programming is valid but 
if working game server get down we should debug it 
based on the memory dump 

Suppose function Test() became inline function by compiler 
and its internal variables got processed as either 
constant variable or completely ignored 

조사식 변수 탐색으로도 안 나오고 
Assembly debugging, see main function Compiler Test function 
got inline and removed 

In real stateful server in live service, it notices 
what function caused error, but it does not show 
our stack variables a x y inside Test function  

Debugging is tremndously notorious you shoud analyze 
disassembly debugging from the source code watching 
최적화 컴파일 

So, 최적화 컴파일 Compiler Optimization do or not ? 

In best cases optimized compile increase performance about 30 ~ 40 % better =
So for commercial use it is good to use optimal compile. 
Game server live continues, add functions fix bugs but server got down consistently 

## Most recommended study environment setup 

- Turn off Optimal Compile 
- Use Release Mode, just no optimal compile 
- Goal is to debug during live service 
- more important than server performance 
- Also program codes more optimally 

If no optimal compile no need to use `volatile` 
`volatile` is required if optimal compile applied 

C++ functions, do not turn this function as `inline`. 
```cpp
[[noinline]] // For some 
__declspec(noinline) // MSVC 
__attribute__((noinline)) // GCC / Clang 
void func() {
    // ... 
}
```

Currently C++ STL and all functions they have very complicated wrapping layers 
So without optimal compile speed is awful. 
C++ STL is based on optimal compile so turning it off is not likely choice 

.cpp file level turn on or off optimal compile 
inline function optimal code 

### Release Build is recommended 

C / C++ Runtime Library 

When based on Debug and switch to Release build 
Countless Memory related bugs come out, and they are hard to find. 
Wrong code but debug mode let them work without problem. 

Release Mode turned off > Debug Mode difference ? 
Release Build is basic task and optimize it there 

- Default 


### Security of Game Server 

Generally it is impossible for external computer to get 
access to admin or root for our Stateful server, since 
only service port is opened and rest is blocked. 

This can be another method to enforce not use this as inline function  

### 2's Compliment 

Doing two operation for 2's Compliment should return same order 

Basically Flip 0 and 1 then Add 1 

0x1100 12 = -4 
0x0011 3 
0x0100 4 

0x0100 4 
0x1011 11  
0x1100 12 

뒤집고 더하기 둘다 
같은 연산을 두번 하면 같은 결과가 나와야 되니까 

0x0011 3 
0x1100 12 
0x1101 13 

0x1101 13 
0x0010 2 
0x0011 3 

뒤집고 1 더하기 
뒤집고 1 더하기 두번 하면 원래 수로 와야 함 
그게 보수법
