### Speed of Prefix vs Postfix Operator 

Generally, prefix operator like `++a` is considered as 
more efficient thatn postfix operator like `a++`, as 

postfix `a++` should temporarily save original value and return it 
while prefix `++a` can return value itself with temporal save. 

However, in assembly perspective, for basic simple datatype like `int` 
postfix `a++` might be efficient sometimes. 

```txt
     7:     volatile int a = 0; 
00BF15D4 C7 45 FC 00 00 00 00 mov         dword ptr [a],0  
     8:     volatile int b = ++a;
00BF15DB 8B 45 FC             mov         eax,dword ptr [a]  
00BF15DE 83 C0 01             add         eax,1  
00BF15E1 89 45 FC             mov         dword ptr [a],eax  
00BF15E4 8B 4D FC             mov         ecx,dword ptr [a]  
00BF15E7 89 4D F8             mov         dword ptr [b],ecx  
     9: 
    10:     a = 0xffffffff;
00BF15EA C7 45 FC FF FF FF FF mov         dword ptr [a],0FFFFFFFFh  
    11:     b = a++; 
00BF15F1 8B 45 FC             mov         eax,dword ptr [a]  
00BF15F4 89 45 F8             mov         dword ptr [b],eax  
00BF15F7 8B 4D FC             mov         ecx,dword ptr [a]  
00BF15FA 83 C1 01             add         ecx,1  
00BF15FD 89 4D FC             mov         dword ptr [a],ecx  
``` 

In this case, for `++a` prefix, assembly is loaded from memory to 
register `eax`, and incremented 1 and saved to original memory. 
Then, `ptr[a]` is copied to register ecx and saved to `ptr[b]`.

On the other hand, for `a++` prefix, assembly is loaded from 
`ptr[a]` to register `eax`, and then saved directly to `ptr[b]` 
and then increment operation executes. 

Considering that the memory load and store process takes the 
most amount of time, for basic data types like this 
prefix and postfix do not have huge difference, and for basic 
datatypes like int or long, postfix might be slightly faster. 
To see this level of analysis, disassembly is necessary! 

### Bit Operator 

```txt
& AND 
^ XOR 
| OR 
~ Flip All 
<< Shift left 
>> Shift Right 
a = 0xaf 
a & 0xf0 = 11110000; 
a = 0xa0 
```

In Network IP Setup 

```txt
         IP 192 168   0   10  
Subnet Mask 255 255 255    0 
```

Subnet Mask exist for `&` bit `AND` operator so that 
IP address became its network ID. 
That is why sometimes Subnet Mask is 255 255 255 128 or similar 
Subnet Mask is for bit calculation masking. 

```txt
    192.168.  0. 10 (11000000.10101000.00000000.00001010)  
&   255.255.255.  0 (11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000)  
=   192.168.  0.  0 (11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000)  // Network Address 
``` 

Bit Operator `|` `OR` exist to combined divided bitsinto one 
```
X   1001 1011 0000 0000 
Y   0000 0000 1101 1010 
OR  1001 1011 1101 1010
```
Like this. 

Bit Operator `^` `XOR` has characteristic to return same value 
if `XOR` is applied with flipped value, like `A XOR B XOR B == A`, 
if and only if `(B == ~A)`

```
A   01011010 
XOR 11010110 
~A  10001100 
XOR 11010110
A   01011010 
```

Simple encryption might work in `XOR` operator. Also, 
Assembly languages like `XOR eax eax` will reset register value to 0 
quicker than `mov eax 0`. 
so inside disassembly code `mov eax 0` it actually is doing `XOR eax eax`. 

**Shift Bit Operator**

This can actually be used as some form of multiplication or division 
a >> 1 2 4 as /2 /4 /8, and a << 1 2 4 as *2 *4 *8 
Hard to read so not recommended or should be used with comments 

Shift operation of the unsigned value moves literally in direction. 
Its empty space will be filled by 0 only. 
However, shift operation of the signed value operates differently. 
For signed variables, first bit represents negative number. 
Also, it is based on 2's compliment. 


### Switch Case optimization 

switch case vs if else 
In assembly perspective, given cases are in sequential order from 1 to n, 
switch case is much efficient compared to if else, especially if 
if else if functions get bigger. 

**Case 1 : Switch Case num in order from 1 to n** 

```cpp 
switch (num) {
    case 1: /**/ break; 
    case 2: /**/ break; 
    case 3: /**/ break; 
}
```
Assembly codes look like this 

```txt  
10:     switch (num) {
00073341 83 7D B4 06          cmp         dword ptr [ebp-4Ch],6    // Compare 6 and temp variable 
00073345 77 47                ja          $LN10+7h (07338Eh)  // jump if [ebp-4Ch] > 6 
00073347 8B 55 B4             mov         edx,dword ptr [ebp-4Ch]  
0007334A FF 24 95 A8 33 07 00 jmp         dword ptr [edx*4+733A8h]
11:     case 1 : 
12:         x = 123; 
0007334A FF 24 95 A8 33 07 00 jmp         dword ptr [edx*4+733A8h]  
13:         break; 
00073358 EB 34                jmp         $LN10+7h (07338Eh)  
```

Switch Case, given cases are in order, will move based on 
calculation of switch case registered value inside `ecx`, 
with multiplication access by `ptr [edx*4+733A8h]`
instead of if else function based on multiple `cmp` execution 
improving speed performance way much faster. 

**Case 2 : Switch Case num with very large numbers** 

```cpp 
switch (num) {
    case 123421: /**/ break; 
    case 21342: /**/ break; 
    case 33214: /**/ break; 
}
```

In this case, it is not likely to use method above 

```txt
00BA3332 8B 45 FC             mov         eax,dword ptr [num]  
00BA3335 89 45 B4             mov         dword ptr [ebp-4Ch],eax  
00BA3338 81 7D B4 9E 5B 00 00 cmp         dword ptr [ebp-4Ch],5B9Eh  
00BA333F 7F 26                jg          main+57h (0BA3367h)  
00BA3341 81 7D B4 9E 5B 00 00 cmp         dword ptr [ebp-4Ch],5B9Eh 
00BA3348 74 55                je          main+8Fh (0BA339Fh)  
00BA334A 81 7D B4 09 09 00 00 cmp         dword ptr [ebp-4Ch],909h 
``` 

So internally, it works with lots of `cmp` and `jne` same as if else statement. 
Thus, performance improvement of if else if same. 

**Case 3 : Switch Case num with sequential numbers with missing** 

```cpp 
switch (num) {
    case 10: /**/ break; 
    case 12: /**/ break; 
    case 15: /**/ break; 
}
```

This way, instead of using `cmp` and `jne` like if else statement 
there is better option 

```txt 
switch (num)
00FC3332 8B 45 FC             mov         eax,dword ptr [num]  
00FC3335 89 45 B4             mov         dword ptr [ebp-4Ch],eax  
00FC3338 8B 4D B4             mov         ecx,dword ptr [ebp-4Ch]  
00FC333B 83 E9 0A             sub         ecx,0Ah  
00FC333E 89 4D B4             mov         dword ptr [ebp-4Ch],ecx  
00FC3341 83 7D B4 0A          cmp         dword ptr [ebp-4Ch],0Ah  
00FC3345 77 47                ja          $LN10+7h (0FC338Eh)  
00FC3347 8B 55 B4             mov         edx,dword ptr [ebp-4Ch]  
00FC334A FF 24 95 A8 33 FC 00 jmp         dword ptr [edx*4+0FC33A8h] 
```

This one pre calculates switch value to 0 by subtracting 10 
in `sub ecx,0Ah` assembly. Then, it starts with 10 but how about 
jump gaps between 0 2 5 ... ? The concept of gap exists. 
If moved to pointer of `jmp         dword ptr [edx*4+0FC33A8h]` 
then it is possible to check the jump table area in Memory view of VS2022, 
which is generated right after code area like following. 

```
    36:     return 0; 
00FF339F 33 C0                xor         eax,eax  
    37: }
00FF33A1 5F                   pop         edi  
00FF33A2 5E                   pop         esi  
00FF33A3 5B                   pop         ebx  
00FF33A4 8B E5                mov         esp,ebp  
00FF33A6 5D                   pop         ebp  
00FF33A7 C3                   ret  
00FF33A8 51                   push        ecx  // These are not assembly code anymore 
00FF33A9 33 FF                xor         edi,edi  // just pointer values 
00FF33AB 00 8E 33 FF 00 5A    add         byte ptr [esi+5A00FF33h],cl  
```

This is actually `jump tables`, not codes anymore, after `ret`. 

```
0x00FF33A8  51 33 ff 00  pointer to case_10
0x00FF33AC  8e 33 ff 00  pointer to default
0x00FF33B0  5a 33 ff 00  pointer to case_12
0x00FF33B4  8e 33 ff 00  pointer to default
0x00FF33B8  8e 33 ff 00  pointer to default
0x00FF33BC  63 33 ff 00  pointer to case_15 
```

Question : Is this data section or code section? 
Answer : It depends. Here might be either code section `.text` area
`relocattion targets`, or sometimes list of pointer variables in `.rodata`
area data section. 

Program Counter 
or IP Instruction Register in X86 will not go after `ret`. 

For switch case analysis, disassembly is required, again!
