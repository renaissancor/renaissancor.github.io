## Key Points

- Data types define the size and purpose of variables in memory.
- Each type has a default range and behavior, especially with signed vs unsigned.
- Type casting allows explicit conversion between types.
- Floating-point numbers follow the IEEE standard.

## Overview

In C++, data types determine how memory is allocated for variables and how operations are performed. Understanding data types is fundamental for both correctness and performance.

## Primitive Data Types

### Integer Types

Integer types store whole numbers and can be either signed (default) or unsigned.

```cpp
// Signed: can represent negative and positive values
signed char sc = 0;    // Range: -128 to 127

// Unsigned: only non-negative values
unsigned char uc = 0;  // Range: 0 to 255

sc = 128;  // Triggers overflow, behavior is implementation-defined
uc = 128;  // Valid
```

### Integer Size Summary

- `bool` ??? 1 byte
- `char` ??? 1 byte
- `short` ??? 2 bytes
- `int` ??? 4 bytes
- `long` ??? 4 bytes (platform dependent)
- `long long` ??? 8 bytes

### Signed vs Unsigned Behavior

Signed integers can represent both positive and negative values using two's complement representation. To convert a positive binary to its negative form, invert the bits and add 1.

```cpp
char c = 256;                  // Overflow: wraps around to 0
unsigned char unchar = -1;     // Stores 255 due to wrap-around
```

---

## Floating-Point Types

Floating-point types store real numbers, including decimals. They follow the IEEE 754 standard for binary representation.

```cpp
float fData = 3.66f;  // 4 bytes
float fResult;

int iData = 20;
fResult = (float)iData + fData;  // Type casting to float for precise addition
```

### Initialization vs Assignment

```cpp
int i = 10;     // Initialization
float f;
f = 20.5f;      // Assignment
```

---

## Type Conversion and Casting

### Implicit Conversion

Assigning an integer to a float will automatically cast the value:

```cpp
float f = 3;  // Implicitly becomes 3.0
```

### Explicit Casting

Use C-style casting for precise control:

```cpp
float result = (float)iData + fData;
```

## Common Mistakes

**Overflow on signed/unsigned types:**
```cpp
signed char sc = 128;  // Undefined or implementation-defined
```

**Assigning negative to unsigned types:**
```cpp
unsigned char uc = -1; // Becomes 255
```

**Assigning float to int:**
```cpp
int i = 3.99;  // i = 3, truncates decimal part
```

## Interview Questions

**Q: What is the difference between signed and unsigned types?**  
A: Signed types represent both negative and positive values using two's complement. Unsigned types can only represent zero and positive values.

**Q: What happens when you assign a negative number to an unsigned variable?**  
A: The value wraps around using modulo arithmetic. For example, `unsigned char uc = -1;` results in `uc = 255`.

**Q: What is the difference between float and double?**  
A: `float` uses 4 bytes and has lower precision. `double` uses 8 bytes and offers higher precision for decimal values.

**Q: When should you use explicit casting in C++?**  
A: When combining different data types in operations, such as adding an int to a float, or to avoid implicit conversion bugs.
