## Key Points

- Recursion involves a function calling itself.
- Recursive functions must include a termination condition to prevent infinite calls.
- Iterative approaches can replace recursion for performance.
- Local variables are stored in the stack during function calls.
- Stack overflow can occur if recursion is too deep or unbounded.

## Overview

Functions in C++ are modular blocks of code that perform a specific task. Understanding how they work at runtime and how memory is allocated during execution is essential for debugging and optimizing performance. Recursive functions, in particular, are elegant for solving hierarchical problems but require careful handling.

---

## Iterative Factorial Function

```cpp
// Calculates N! using iteration
int Factorial(int _N)
{
    int Value = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < _N - 1; ++i)
    {
        Value *= (i + 2);
    }

    return Value;
}
```

This function computes factorial using a for-loop, multiplying from 2 to N. It avoids stack usage beyond the function call.

---

## Recursive Factorial Function

```cpp
// Calculates N! using recursion
int Factorial_Recursion(int _N)
{
    if (_N == 1)
        return 1;

    return Factorial_Recursion(_N - 1) * _N;
}
```

This approach uses the call stack to solve the problem. It's more readable but can lead to stack overflow for large values.

---

## Power Function (Iterative)

```cpp
int Pow(int _a, int _b)
{
    int Value = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < _b; ++i)
    {
        Value *= _a;
    }

    return Value;
}
```

Raises `_a` to the power `_b` using a loop. Simple and avoids recursive overhead.

---

## Infinite Recursion Example (Caution!)

```cpp
void NewFunc(int a)
{
    NewFunc(100);  // No termination -> infinite recursion!
}
```

This function continuously calls itself with a constant value. Without a base case, it causes a stack overflow.

---

## Function Call Mechanics

- Each function call uses a new stack frame.
- Local variables reside in the stack.
- Stack grows with each recursive call until the base case is reached or overflow occurs.

```cpp
int main()
{
    int i = Pow(2, 4);       // 16
    i = Pow(10, 4);          // 10000

    int c = 10;
    c = 20;

    NewFunc(100);            // Infinite recursion: stack overflow

    return 0;
}
```

Use breakpoints and step execution to observe the stack behavior during debugging.

---

## Debugging Tips

- **F5**: Start/continue debugging
- **F9**: Toggle breakpoint
- **F10**: Step over (function as a block)
- **F11**: Step into (enter function call)
- **Ctrl + Shift + F9**: Clear all breakpoints

These commands help you trace function execution and understand stack changes.

## Interview Questions

**Q: What is a recursive function?**  
A: A function that calls itself to solve a subproblem.

**Q: What are the dangers of recursion?**  
A: Infinite recursion can cause a stack overflow if there's no proper termination condition.

**Q: Can all recursive logic be written iteratively?**  
A: Yes, but sometimes recursion improves readability, especially for tree and graph problems.

**Q: Why is the stack important in recursion?**  
A: Each recursive call stores its context (variables, return address) on the stack.

## Tricky Case: Recursion vs Iteration

Recursive code:
```cpp
int Factorial_Recursion(int n) {
    if (n == 1) return 1;
    return Factorial_Recursion(n - 1) * n;
}
```

Equivalent iterative code:
```cpp
int Factorial(int n) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i)
        result *= i;
    return result;
}
```

Prefer the iterative approach if performance and stack safety are priorities.
