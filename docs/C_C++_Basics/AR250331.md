# Class vs Struct, Encapsulation, and Const-Correctness

### Date: 2025-03-31

## Key Points

- Both `class` and `struct` are user-defined types in C++, with default access specifiers differing.
- C++ `class` introduces object-oriented features: encapsulation, information hiding, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Use `private` to enforce data hiding and `public` to expose member functions.
- Const correctness (`const` after member functions) ensures safe access for constant objects.
- Member initialization for `const` variables must be done using initializer lists.
- `this` pointer implicitly refers to the current object instance.

## Overview

C++ builds upon C by introducing the concept of `class` with rich object-oriented features. While C relies on `struct` for custom data types, C++ uses both `class` and `struct`, with the key distinction being the default access specifier (`private` for `class`, `public` for `struct`).

### Example: Basic struct and class

```cpp
struct MyData {
public:
    int iData;
};

class CMyData {
private:
    int iData;
};

int main() {
    MyData data = {};
    data.iData = 0; // OK: public access

    CMyData CData = {};
    // CData.iData = 0; // Error: private member
    return 0;
}
```

## Common Mistakes

**Assuming structs are limited compared to classes**
```cpp
struct S {
    void func(); // Valid in C++
};
```
In C++, `struct` can have methods, constructors, destructors, inheritance, etc.

**Ignoring access specifier defaults**
```cpp
struct S { int a; };  // a is public
class C { int a; };   // a is private
```

**Failing to use initializer list for `const` members**
```cpp
class C {
    const int val;
public:
    C() : val(10) {}  // Required for const
};
```

---

## Const Member Functions

Member functions that do not modify the state of the object should be marked `const`. This ensures they can be safely called on constant objects or pointers to constant objects.

```cpp
class CNewClass {
private:
    int m_i;
    const int m_i2;

public:
    int GetInt() const { return m_i; }
    int GetInt2() const { return m_i2; }

    void SetData(int _a) { m_i = _a; }

    CNewClass() : m_i(200), m_i2(400) {}
    ~CNewClass() {}
};

int main() {
    const CNewClass obj;
    int x = obj.GetInt();   // OK
    int y = obj.GetInt2();  // OK
    // obj.SetData(10);     // Error: cannot modify const object
    return 0;
}
```

## Tricky Case: Memory Alignment in Structs

C++ aligns data in structs based on the size of the largest member unless specified otherwise.

```cpp
#pragma pack(1)
struct tMyStruct {
    int   i;
    int   i2;
    short s;
    char  c;
};

int main() {
    tMyStruct my = {};
    int size = sizeof(tMyStruct); // Size tightly packed due to #pragma pack(1)
    return 0;
}
```

Without `#pragma pack(1)`, compilers may add padding for performance, changing the total size.

## Interview Questions

**Q: Difference between `struct` and `class` in C++?**  
A: Functionally similar, but `struct` defaults to public members while `class` defaults to private.

**Q: Why mark getter functions as `const`?**  
A: It ensures the method can be called on const objects and doesnâ€™t modify the object's state.

**Q: When must initializer lists be used?**  
A: For initializing `const` or reference data members in constructors.

**Q: What does the `this` pointer represent?**  
A: It holds the address of the current object and is used implicitly to access member variables inside class methods.

## Visual: Class Member Access

```
Object: CNewClass my
---------------------
Private:
  m_i   = accessible only via member functions
  m_i2  = accessible only via member functions

Public:
  GetInt()   --> returns m_i
  GetInt2()  --> returns m_i2
  SetData()  --> modifies m_i
```

---

## Code Demonstration

```cpp
CNewClass my;
int i = my.GetInt();
i = my.GetInt2();

CNewClass* pNC = &my;
i = pNC->GetInt();
i = pNC->GetInt2();

const CNewClass* pConstNC = &my;
i = pConstNC->GetInt();
i = pConstNC->GetInt2();
```
