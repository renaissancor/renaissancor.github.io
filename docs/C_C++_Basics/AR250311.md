# Local Variables, Arrays, & Loops

## Key Points

- Local variables are scoped to blocks and their lifetime ends with the block.
- Variable name collisions in nested scopes cause ambiguity.
- Arrays occupy continuous memory; their name points to the starting address.
- Use `sizeof()` to determine array size in memory.
- Loops allow repetitive execution of code blocks; be cautious of infinite loops.
- `break` exits a loop immediately; `continue` skips the current iteration.

## Overview

This example introduces basic concepts in C++, including:
- Local variable scoping
- Arrays and memory layout
- Control flow using `while`, `for`, and nested loops

We also touch on size evaluation using `sizeof()` and demonstrate a star-pattern using nested loops.

## Local Variables and Scope

Variables declared inside functions are **local**. Re-declaring a variable name in a nested scope creates ambiguity if not managed properly:

```cpp
int a1 = 0;
{
    int a1 = 0; // Hides outer a1
    a1 = 10;
    {
        int a1 = 0; // Hides above a1
    }
}
a1 = 10; // Refers to the outermost a1
```

Variables declared in a scope are destroyed once the block ends, but the memory might not be immediately released.

---

## Arrays in C++

Arrays consist of elements stored in contiguous memory. The array name represents the starting address.

```cpp
int Arr[10] = {1, 2}; // Remaining elements initialized to 0

Arr[0] = 10;
Arr[1] = 20;
Arr[9] = 100;

int data = Arr[9]; // Accessing the last element
```

### Size Calculation
```cpp
int size = sizeof(Arr);             // Total byte size
int ArrCount = sizeof(Arr) / sizeof(int); // Number of elements
```

---

## Loops

### While Loop
```cpp
int Count = 0;
while (Count < 4) {
    ++Count;
}
```

### Infinite Loop with `break`
```cpp
int C = 0;
while (1) {
    ++C;
    if (C == 4) break;
}
```

### For Loop with Commented Game Logic
```cpp
for (int Count = 0; Count < 4; ++Count) {
    // if (Object[Count]->IsMonster()) {
    //     SetDamage(Object[Count]);
    // } else {
    //     continue;
    // }
}
```

### Populating Array with Loop
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < ArrCount; ++i) {
    Arr[i] = (i + 1) * 10;
    printf("Output\n");
}
```

### Nested Loop: Triangle Star Pattern
```cpp
int Num = 5;
for (int j = 0; j < Num; ++j) {
    for (int i = 0; i < (j + 1); ++i) {
        printf("*");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```
This prints:
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

## Homework Tip

Print a **balanced tree star pattern** using nested loops and space alignment:
```
    *
   * *
  * * *
 * * * *
* * * * *
```
Use careful spacing before the `*` in each row.

### 
Homework Code 
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    unsigned int n = 10; 
    // std::cin >> n; 

    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
		for (unsigned int j = 1; j < n-i; ++j)
		{
            std::cout << " ";  
		}

        for (unsigned int j = 0; j < i; ++j)
        {
			std::cout << " ";
			std::cout << "*";
        }

		std::cout << "\n";
    }
}
```

output 

```
         *
        * *
       * * *
      * * * *
     * * * * *
    * * * * * *
   * * * * * * *
  * * * * * * * *
 * * * * * * * * *
 ```
Returns well

## Sample Interview Questions

**Q: What happens if you declare a variable with the same name in an inner scope?**  
A: It hides the outer variable. Only the innermost declared variable is visible within its scope.

**Q: How do arrays behave in memory?**  
A: Array elements are stored in contiguous memory blocks. The array name acts as the pointer to its first element.

**Q: What is the difference between `break` and `continue` in a loop?**  
A: `break` exits the loop immediately; `continue` skips to the next iteration.

**Q: Why is `sizeof` useful in loops?**  
A: It helps calculate the number of elements in a statically declared array, which avoids hardcoding loop limits.
