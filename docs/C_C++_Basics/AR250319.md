# Pointer Basics and Function Overloading

## Key Points

- Pointers store memory addresses; their size is typically 8 bytes on modern systems.
- `&` retrieves a variable's address, `*` dereferences a pointer.
- `void*` is a generic pointer type, but cannot be dereferenced directly.
- Pointer arithmetic depends on the pointer's data type.
- Arrays and pointers are closely related; array indexing uses pointer arithmetic.
- Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different signatures.

## Overview

This code snippet covers fundamental C++ concepts including pointer usage, function overloading, pointer casting, and memory operations using external functions like `MemSet` and `MemMove`.

Let's walk through the details.

## Function Overloading in C++

Function overloading allows the same function name to be used with different parameter lists.

```cpp
int Test(int _a) {
    return 10;
}

void Test(float _f) {
}

void Test(int _a, int _b = 0) {
}

int main() {
    Test(1.1f);    // Calls void Test(float)
    Test(10, 20);  // Calls void Test(int, int)
    return 0;
}
```

### Tricky Case: Default Parameters and Overloading
Be cautious when using default parameters with overloaded functions??봳hey can lead to ambiguity.

## Pointer Fundamentals

Pointers are variables that store memory addresses.

```cpp
int i = 0;
char c = 0;
short s = 0;

int*   pI = 0;
char*  pC = 0;
short* pS = 0;

pI = &i;
pC = &c;
pS = &s;

*pI = 10;
*pC = 20;
*pS = 30;
```

Declaring a pointer with a type (e.g., `int*`) defines how the memory at that address will be interpreted.

---

## Pointer Casting

```cpp
pI = (int*)&c;
pC = (char*)&i;
```

This forces interpretation of memory as another type. Use with caution??봧t bypasses type safety.

---

## Void Pointers

```cpp
void* pVoid = 0;
pVoid = &i;
pVoid = &c;
pVoid = &s;
```

`void*` can store any address but must be cast to another type before dereferencing.

```cpp
// Invalid:
// pS = pVoid;
```

---

## Memory Utilities

Assuming the following external functions:

```cpp
void MemSet(void* _pData, int _Size);
void MemMove(void* _pData, int _Size, void* _Src);
```

### Example Usage

```cpp
short arr[10];
MemSet(arr, 20);

int k;
MemSet(&k, sizeof(int));

int iArr[10] = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 };
int iArrOther[10] = {};
MemMove(iArrOther, sizeof(int) * 10, iArr);
```

---

## Pointer Arithmetic

```cpp
int* pInt = 0;
pInt += 1;  // Moves pointer by sizeof(int)

short* pShort = 0;
pShort += 1;  // Moves pointer by sizeof(short)
```

The increment steps over a number of bytes depending on the type.

---

## Array and Pointer Relationship

```cpp
int iTest[5] = {};
pInt = iTest;

pInt[0] = 1;  // *(pInt + 0)
pInt[1] = 2;  // *(pInt + 1)
```

Array indexing is syntactic sugar for pointer arithmetic.

## Interview Questions

**Q: What is a pointer in C++?**  
A: A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

**Q: Can you dereference a void pointer?**  
A: No, a `void*` must first be cast to a specific type before dereferencing.

**Q: How is pointer arithmetic affected by the data type?**  
A: The pointer moves in steps of the size of the data type it points to (e.g., `int*` moves 4 bytes, `short*` moves 2 bytes).

**Q: What's the relationship between arrays and pointers?**  
A: An array name is effectively a pointer to its first element. Array indexing uses pointer arithmetic under the hood.

**Q: What is the purpose of function overloading?**  
A: Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name to coexist as long as their signatures differ.

## Visual: Pointer Arithmetic

```
int* pInt = 0;
pInt += 1;

Before: pInt = 0x1000
After : pInt = 0x1004 (assuming int = 4 bytes)
```

Keep these principles in mind when dealing with pointers. 
They're powerful but error-prone if misused. 
Use pointer casting and void pointers with caution, 
and always be aware of type sizes when doing arithmetic.
