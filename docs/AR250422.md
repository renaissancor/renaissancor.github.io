# C++ Inheritance and Object Lifecycle: A Complete Guide for Game Programmers

*Last updated: April 22, 2025*

This article provides a thorough explanation of C++ inheritance mechanics, with special focus on the object lifecycle, memory management, and common pitfalls. It's designed as a study resource for game programming interviews where these concepts frequently appear.

## Introduction to Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental object-oriented programming concept that allows classes to derive properties and behaviors from other classes. In C++, it enables code reuse, extensibility, and the establishment of hierarchical relationships between classes.

A derived class (or child class) inherits accessible members from a base class (or parent class), extending its functionality while maintaining the core characteristics of the parent.

    class CParent {
        -int m_I
        -int* m_pData
        +SetData(int)
        +GetData() : int
        +CParent()
        +CParent(int)
        +~CParent()
    }

    class CChild {
        -float m_F
        -float* m_pFloatData
        +SetFloat(float)
        +GetFloat() : float
        +CChild()
        +CChild(int, float)
        +~CChild()
    }

    CChild --|> CParent
```

This UML diagram provides a quick reference to the relationship between `CParent` and `CChild`, highlighting member variables and methods.

## Class Structure and Access Control

In C++, the access specifier used in inheritance dictates how base class members can be accessed by the derived class:

- **public inheritance**: The most common form, preserving the access level of base class members
- **protected inheritance**: All public members of the base class become protected in the derived class
- **private inheritance**: All public and protected members of the base class become private in the derived class

Let's examine a practical example using `CParent` as our base class and `CChild` as the derived class:

```cpp
class CParent {
protected:
    int m_I;
    int* m_pData;

public:
    void SetData(int _Data) { m_I = _Data; }
    int GetData() { return m_I; }

    CParent() : m_I(0), m_pData(new int[100]) {}
    CParent(int _Data) : m_I(_Data), m_pData(new int[100]) {}

    ~CParent() {
        if (m_pData) delete[] m_pData;
    }
};

class CChild : public CParent {
private:
    float m_F;
    float* m_pFloatData;

public:
    void SetFloat(float _F) {
        m_I = 100; // accessing protected member from base class
        m_F = _F;
    }
    float GetFloat() { return m_F; }

    CChild() : m_F(0.f), m_pFloatData(new float[1000]) {}
    CChild(int _IntData, float _FloatData)
        : CParent(_IntData), m_F(_FloatData), m_pFloatData(new float[1000]) {}

    ~CChild() {
        if (m_pFloatData) delete[] m_pFloatData;
        // CParent destructor called automatically
    }
};
```

Notice how:
- The `CParent` class uses the `protected` access modifier for member variables, allowing derived classes to access them directly
- `CChild` can access the protected `m_I` member from `CParent`
- Both classes properly manage their dynamically allocated memory

## Object Lifecycle in Inheritance

Understanding the precise order of construction and destruction is crucial for proper resource management in C++.

### Construction Order

When a derived class object is created, the construction sequence follows a specific order:

1. Base class constructor is called first
2. Derived class constructor is called after

Example:

```cpp
CChild child;  // First calls CParent(), then CChild()
CChild child1(100, 2.2f);  // First calls CParent(100), then CChild's constructor
```

### Initialization Lists

An important detail: derived class constructors can only initialize their own members directly in the initialization list. Base class members must be initialized by calling the appropriate base class constructor:

```cpp
CChild(int _IntData, float _FloatData)
    : CParent(_IntData),  // Call base constructor to initialize base members
      m_F(_FloatData),    // Initialize own members
      m_pFloatData(new float[1000]) {}
```

### Destruction Order

When objects are destroyed, the order is reversed:

1. Derived class destructor executes first
2. Base class destructor executes after

This reverse order ensures that derived class resources are cleaned up before base class resources.

## Memory Management in Derived Classes

Proper memory management is critical in C++ inheritance hierarchies to prevent memory leaks and undefined behavior.

### Key Points:

1. **Constructor/Destructor Pairing**: Every constructor that allocates resources must have a corresponding destructor that deallocates them.
2. **Resource Ownership**: Be clear about which class owns which resources.
3. **Destructor Chain**: Destructors are called automatically in reverse order of inheritance.

For example, in our sample code:

```cpp
~CChild() {
    // Clean up resources owned by CChild
    if (m_pFloatData) delete[] m_pFloatData;
    // CParent destructor is called automatically after this
}
```

This ensures that the `m_pFloatData` resource is freed before the base class destructor runs to free `m_pData`.

## Copy Construction in Inheritance

The compiler automatically generates a copy constructor if one isn't explicitly defined. However, this default copy constructor performs a shallow copy, which can lead to problems with dynamically allocated resources.

### Default Copy Constructor Issue

In our class hierarchy, the default copy constructor would look something like:

```cpp
CChild(const CChild& _Other)
    : CParent(),  // Default constructor, not copy constructor!
    m_F(_Other.m_F),
    m_pFloatData(new float[1000]) {
    // Copy values from _Other.m_pFloatData
}
```

This is problematic because it calls the default constructor for `CParent`, not its copy constructor.

### Correct Copy Constructor

A proper copy constructor should explicitly call the base class copy constructor:

```cpp
CChild(const CChild& _Other)
    : CParent(_Other),  // Call base copy constructor
    m_F(_Other.m_F),
    m_pFloatData(new float[1000]) {
    // Deep copy values from _Other.m_pFloatData
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        m_pFloatData[i] = _Other.m_pFloatData[i];
    }
}
```

## Polymorphism and Virtual Functions

When working with inheritance, polymorphism allows derived classes to override base class methods and for those overridden methods to be called correctly even through a base class pointer.

In C++, this requires the use of the `virtual` keyword:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void Method() { /* base implementation */ }
    virtual ~Base() {}  // Virtual destructor is crucial!
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void Method() override { /* derived implementation */ }
    ~Derived() {}
};
```

### Virtual Destructors

A common mistake is forgetting to declare destructors as virtual in base classes intended for polymorphic use. Without a virtual destructor, deleting a derived object through a base pointer leads to undefined behavior:

```cpp
Base* ptr = new Derived();
delete ptr;  // Without virtual destructor, only ~Base() is called, leaking resources
```

## Random Number Generation

While not directly related to inheritance, the notes also included information about random number generation in C++, which is often used in game programming:

```cpp
// Seed the random number generator
srand(time(nullptr));  // Uses current time as seed for randomization

// Generate random numbers between 1 and 100
int random_number = rand() % 100 + 1;  // Returns 1-100
```

This technique creates a random number between 1 and 100 by:
1. Using `rand()` to generate a pseudo-random integer
2. Taking the modulo (%) to restrict it to a range (0-99)
3. Adding 1 to shift the range to 1-100

For more complex game systems, using the C++11 random library provides better statistical properties:

```cpp
#include <random>
#include <chrono>

unsigned seed = std::chrono::system_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count();
std::default_random_engine generator(seed);
std::uniform_int_distribution<int> distribution(1, 100);

int random_number = distribution(generator);  // More robust randomization
```

## Interview Questions and Exercises

Here are some common interview questions related to C++ inheritance, with answers based on the material covered:

**Q: What's the order of constructor and destructor calls in inheritance?**  
A: Constructors execute from base to derived. Destructors execute from derived to base.

**Q: What happens if a derived class allocates memory but doesn't define a destructor?**  
A: Memory leaks may occur if the derived class allocates resources but doesn't clean them up in its destructor.

**Q: Why use protected instead of private?**  
A: Protected members allow access from derived classes while still hiding them from external code. Private members are inaccessible to derived classes.

**Q: Can derived constructors initialize base members directly?**  
A: No, derived constructors must use the initialization list to call base constructors for initializing base class members.

**Q: What's the purpose of a virtual destructor?**  
A: Virtual destructors ensure that the proper destructor chain is called when deleting a derived object through a base class pointer.

## Common Mistakes and Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting virtual destructors** in polymorphic base classes
   ```cpp
   class Base {
   public:
       virtual ~Base() {}  // Required for proper cleanup
   };
   ```

2. **Attempting to access private base members** from derived classes
   - Only protected or public members are accessible to derived classes

3. **Leaking memory by skipping cleanup**
   - Always match each `new[]` with a corresponding `delete[]`
   - Each allocation in a constructor should have a corresponding deallocation in the destructor

4. **Incorrect copy constructor implementation**
   - Not calling the base class copy constructor
   - Performing shallow copies of pointer members

5. **Improperly initializing base class members**
   - Base class members must be initialized through base class constructors
   - Derived class constructors cannot directly initialize base class members in their initialization lists

### Practice Exercises

**1. Spot the Bug: Copy Constructor**  
What's wrong with this implementation?
```cpp
CChild(const CChild& other)
    : m_F(other.m_F), m_pFloatData(new float[1000]) {}
```
*Hint: Did you initialize the base class properly?*

**2. Lifecycle Challenge**  
Given the class structure, explain the order of construction and destruction in this code:
```cpp
CChild child1;
```
*Write down the sequence and verify your answer.*

**3. Manual Memory Cleanup**  
Modify the following class to prevent memory leaks:
```cpp
class Buggy {
    int* data;
public:
    Buggy() { data = new int[10]; }
    // No destructor!
};
```

## Visual: Object Lifetime in Inheritance
