Assignment : Dynamic Array erase() and pop_back(); 
O(n) 
iterator erase (iterator& TargetIter); 
O(1) pop_back  

In dynamic array after erase, originally dynamic array sequential space allow the 
original space to be still usable, just with following variable. 
However, code should intentionally deform the input iterator& _TargetIter 
after the removal of the erase iterator. 
Return type iterator should be the next element after the deleted element 
Input iterator pointing data should be removed to the array, and 
Input iterator address should be setup into neutralized position. 

// Assignment explanation over 

Also T& front(); and T& back(); should be generated, and easy to implement. 

assert(nullptr) is same as assert(0) 

If head pointer is null the assert should happen 

Also for linked list, pop_front() and pop_back() should be generated. 

template<typename T>
inline void CList::pop_front()
{
    assert(m_Head); // or m_Tail or m_Size whatever 0 or nullptr means list is empty 

    if(nullptr != m_Head->m_Next){
        m_Head->m_Next->m_Prev = nullptr; 

    } else {
        // Data is only one, aka m_Head == m_Tail, so change both as nullptr 
        m_Tail = nullptr; 
    }
    // Access to Second node and let its prev to nullptr since it will be head 

     pNode<T> pHead = m_Head; 
    m_Head = m_Head->next; 
    delete pHead; 
}


Assignments 
1 CArray::erase(iterator &iter), CArray::pop_back() 
2 CList::pop_back() 

Linked List Erase 
iterator erase(iterator & )

When iterator is returned as a return type return with typename 
template<typename T>
typename CList<T>::iterator CList<T>::erase(iterator & _iter)
{
    // Input iterator pointing node should be removed, and 
    // Iterator after deleted iterator should be returned 
}


If type T is same, then iterator could point different list with same type 
The problem is that when erase is called, and iterator actaully points iterator outside that list. 

Check by m_Owner, which represents, iterator contains owner information and it should be same to erase 
assert(_iter.m_Owner)
_iter.m_TargetNode; 

m_Prev, m_Next Addresses exist 
If list has several data managing and iterator points 

in erase of linked list it contains a lot of variablees but most exptional cases are edge cases 
Handled in pop_front and pop_back. 
if(m_Head == _iter.m_TargetNode)
{
    pop_front();
} else if (m_Tail == _iter.m_TargetNode)
{
    pop_back(); 
}
else { // Normal cases, since it must have both prev and next 


}
