iterator cannto exceed the end of the datatype 

dynamic array is inefficient when middle part of data is removed 
so latter elements should be moved one unit. 
In extremely worst case when first one is removed in dynamic array aka vector 
it is not efficient 

However linked list is relatively easier

That is why 
vector only has pop_back it takes only O(1) 
but pop_front for vector will have O(n) time complexity 

vecInt.erase(where) where means iterator 
iter = vecInt.begin(); 
vecInt.erase(iter); 

Similarly in linked list also exists 
list<int>::iterator Liter = intList.begin(); 
intList.erase(Liter); 

vector is dynamic array based data structure 
using the front data is inefficient, so pop_front is not supported 

List is linked list based data structure so specific index access  
among saved data, [] operator or at() function is not supported, 
but iterator allow specific data index value. 

erase usage cautions, after iterator input is erased in list 
so that its iterator value is removed, then iterator became not usable 

*iter let it possible to access the value of the iterater points 
However after it is removed, the *iterator is no longer valid 

since iterator cannot move beyond the end of the data structure 
for loop like iter != array.end(); is safe loop? 

When erase is used be catious during loop 
intList.erase(Liter); // error, since iterator became invalid 
Liter = intList.erase(Liter); // Returns next value of iterator 
// However, this loop also is problematic, since erase already 
move into next iterator, and for loop moves one more step. 
// for(Liter = iList.begin(); iter != iList.end(); iter++) 
for(Liter = iList.begin(); iter != iList.end(); ){
    if(*iter < 60){
        // iList.erase(iter); // iter became invalid 
        iter = iList.erase(iter); // iterator move next this way 
    } else {
        iter++; 
    }
}
return 0; 

iterator can access to 
C array private data 

begin iterator to int reference 

make begin () and end () iterator returning function inside dynamic array 

iterator default generator 
iterator(): m_Owner(nullptr), m_idx(-1); 
iterator generator with input 
iterator(Carray<T> * _Owner, int _Idx)
: m_Owner(_Owner), m_Idx(_Idx){}

based on these generator, iterator begin () will return 
return iterator(this, 0); 

iterator end () will return 
return iterator(this, -1); 

if m_Owner == nullptr && m_IDx == -1 ==> Nothing is pointed iterator 
if m_Owner != nullptr && m_IDx == -1 ==> Certain filled container's end pointing 

if m_Idx == -1 then assert, show error as it is ++ to end iterator 
expressed as assert(m_Idx != -1); 
When end iterator is called with ++. 

if vec.begin () == vec.end() then vector is empty 

if m_curSize == 0 return end iterator for empmty vector this.end() 
Else, meaning vector is not empty return iterator(this, 0); 

When data is not existinig and call begin, end iterator is returned 
AKA begin and end iterators are same, when vector is empty 

Increment, Decrement Operator are separateed into two types ++ -- 
iterator is inner class so can access private data easily 

When defined increment or decrement operator is implemented in custom 
void operator ++(void) // AKA ++iterator

void operator ++(int input == 0) // AKA iterator++ 

++ iterator AKA iterator.operator++(); 
iterator ++ AKA iterator.operator++(0); input is meaningless, always 0. 

Iterator member function operator ++ are just function call.
