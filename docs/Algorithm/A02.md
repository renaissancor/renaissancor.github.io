# Path Finding Algorithm 

BFS DFS 

Dijakstra 
Weighted or Unweighted Graph 

A Start 

Grid 

All same space 

Actual Graph with Vertex and Edge with weights 

Find the Shortest Path, BFS 

So add one element which is A Star 

Instead of watching all surroundings, 
only measure the closest one to the destination 

A Star Result is same as BFS search but actual searches are minimized


Dijakstra add weight to its move 

A Start measures weight of its destination too 

Path Finding Algorithm Implementation 

Based on BFS and DFS complete search implemented before, 
Make source / destination based path finding algorithm 
and make it check. 

How? 
Record Path and show them in result. 
Method 1, make new buffer and save previous location index 
Method 2, make whether previous location direction is up or down. 

Map generation was originally based on 1 byte `unsigned char` for each node. 

However, if Map gets large size, and previous index should be saved, 
first method must use union {unsigned short x, unsigned short y} buffer 
to handle cases when row col size gets over 256. 

Method 2 case, creating buffer map composed of char datatype 
to save previous direction is more space efficient choice.
