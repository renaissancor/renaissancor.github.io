# Path Finding Algorithm 

BFS DFS 

Dijakstra 
Weighted or Unweighted Graph 

A Start 

Grid 

All same space 

Actual Graph with Vertex and Edge with weights 

Find the Shortest Path, BFS 

So add one element which is A Star 

Instead of watching all surroundings, 
only measure the closest one to the destination 

A Star Result is same as BFS search but actual searches are minimized


Dijakstra add weight to its move 

A Start measures weight of its destination too
