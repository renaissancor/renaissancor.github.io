# Hash Table Hashing

**Birthday Problem**

Suppose there are $n$ people in a room. What is the probability that **at least two** of them share the same birthday?

Let:

* $p(n)$: the probability that **at least two** people share a birthday
* $\bar{p}(n) = 1 - p(n)$: the probability that **all birthdays are different**

We compute $\bar{p}(n)$ first:

$$
\bar{p}(n) = \frac{365}{365} \cdot \frac{364}{365} \cdot \frac{363}{365} \cdots \frac{365 - n + 1}{365} = \prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \left( \frac{365 - k}{365} \right)
$$

So,

$$
p(n) = 1 - \bar{p}(n) = 1 - \prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \left( \frac{365 - k}{365} \right)
$$

For instance, when $n = 23$, which is not that large number compared to 365 possible birthdays, 

$$
p(23) \approx 1 - \prod_{k=0}^{22} \left( \frac{365 - k}{365} \right) \approx 0.507
$$

Which is significantly high. 

**Pigeonhole Principle**

When putting $n + 1$ objects in $n$ boxes then at least one box will contain more than one object. 
So, if 366 people are in the room (i.e. $n=366$), and there are only 365 possible birthdays, at least two people must share a birthday: 

$$
p(366) = 1
$$

### Hash Table Analogy

This phenomenon illustrates how **hash collisions** are more likely than expected.

In hashing, if we hash $n$ keys uniformly into $m$ slots, a collision (two keys mapping to the same slot) is quite likely even when $n \ll m$.

The Birthday Paradox shows that:

Collisions occur with **\~50%** probability when $n \approx \sqrt{2m \ln 2} \approx 1.17 \sqrt{m}$

So for $m = 365$, even just 23 inputs lead to a **high chance of collision**.


## Separate Chaning 

Separate Chaining (개별 체이닝) can be described as extension of bucket sort. 




## Comparison between `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`. 

The STL data structure name `map` is related to math `mapping`, since it can be described as 
value finding by key, aka mapping(사상) value to key. 

- `std::map` is Red Black Tree based Binary Search Tree, with Search Time Complexity of $O(n log n)$
- `std::unordered_map` is based on individual chaining similar hash table, with Search time complexity $O(1)$.
