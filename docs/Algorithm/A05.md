# Quick Sort Algorithm 

Randomized Quick Sort 

Quick Sort is based on Divide and Conquer. 
Compared to other sorting mechanisms with same time complexity of $O(n log n)$ 
including heap sort and merge sort, quick sort has way much better performance 
due to its high cache hit probability by using two pointers linearly. 

However, the weakness of Quick Sort is when pivot selection makes the 
worst choice in sequence. For instance, if one array is sorted in descending 
order, and the goal is to re sort it again in ascending order, and 
pivot selection is sequential from 0 to n or vise versa, then the 
pivot value selected might be the biggest or the smallest in order, so that 
It will move pivot only to the edge of the index, resulting in 
time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in the worst case. 

However, application of random selection of pivot might be useful alternative.
