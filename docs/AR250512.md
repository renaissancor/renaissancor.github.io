# Texture Loading and TransparentBlt

## Introduction to Game Graphics Architecture

Game development requires a solid understanding of how images are processed, stored, and displayed. This article explores the fundamental concepts of texture management, bitmap handling, and asset management in Windows game programming using C++.

## Texture and Image Handling Fundamentals

In game development, textures are the visual elements that bring your game world to life. Understanding how to manage these resources efficiently is crucial for performance optimization.

### Texture Loading Pipeline

The basic texture loading process follows these steps:

1. Locate the image file on disk (using relative or absolute paths)
2. Load the image data from SSD/storage into RAM
3. Convert the image into a bitmap format that can be manipulated in memory
4. Use the bitmap for rendering game objects

```cpp
// Example of a relative path structure
// From the game's root directory:
// /Contents/Texture/Fighter.bmp
```

When a game process executes, it operates primarily in RAM. Image files stored on disk (SSD/HDD) must be loaded into memory, converted to bitmaps, and then manipulated for rendering.

### Memory Considerations

A key concept to understand is the difference between storage locations:
- **Image files**: Stored on SSD/HDD (persistent storage)
- **Bitmaps**: Generated in RAM during runtime
- **Executable code**: Runs from RAM

## Windows GDI Graphics Basics

Windows game programming often leverages the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) for 2D rendering. Two core GDI concepts are:

### Device Contexts (DCs)

A Device Context (DC) is an essential Windows graphics concept - it's a handle that represents a drawing surface and contains the information needed to draw on that surface.

```cpp
// Creating a compatible DC
HDC memDC = CreateCompatibleDC(mainDC);
```

### Bitmaps

Bitmaps are representations of image data in memory that can be manipulated and displayed.

```cpp
// Creating an empty bitmap
HBITMAP hBitmap = CreateCompatibleBitmap(mainDC, width, height);

// Selecting the bitmap into a DC
HBITMAP hOldBitmap = (HBITMAP)SelectObject(memDC, hBitmap);
```

## Rendering Techniques

### BitBlt (Bit Block Transfer)

BitBlt is a fundamental Windows GDI function that copies a rectangle of pixels from one DC to another.

```cpp
// Basic BitBlt usage
BitBlt(
    destDC,          // Destination device context
    destX, destY,    // Destination coordinates
    width, height,   // Width and height of area to copy
    sourceDC,        // Source device context
    sourceX, sourceY, // Source coordinates
    SRCCOPY          // Raster operation code
);
```

### TransparentBlt for Transparency

Unlike BitBlt, TransparentBlt allows for transparent regions in your images, which is crucial for game sprites.

```cpp
// TransparentBlt usage
TransparentBlt(
    destDC,          // Destination device context
    destX, destY,    // Destination coordinates 
    width, height,   // Width and height of area to copy
    sourceDC,        // Source device context
    sourceX, sourceY, // Source coordinates
    width, height,   // Source width and height
    transparentColor // Color to treat as transparent
);

// Example of setting magenta as transparent
COLORREF transparentColor = RGB(255, 0, 255);
```

#### Important Note: Linking TransparentBlt

While BitBlt is included in Windows.h by default, TransparentBlt requires an additional library:

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>
#pragma comment(lib, "Msimg32.lib")  // Required for TransparentBlt
```

Without this library link, you'll encounter linker errors (LNK1120) even though the function is declared in wingdi.h.

## Transparency in Game Graphics

### Using Magenta for Transparency

Game programmers often use magenta (RGB 255, 0, 255) as a transparent color because:

1. It's rarely used in actual game graphics
2. Unlike black (0,0,0) or white (255,255,255), which are common colors
3. It's similar to chromakey techniques used in film/TV (though they typically use green)

```cpp
// Setting magenta as the transparent color
TransparentBlt(..., RGB(255, 0, 255));
```

### Player Position and Rendering

When rendering game objects like a player character:

1. Determine the player's position (e.g., coordinates 123, 124)
2. Draw the sprite at that position using TransparentBlt
3. Magenta pixels in the source image will be treated as transparent

## Asset Management

Managing game assets efficiently is crucial for performance and maintainability. A good asset management system needs to:

1. Quickly find and load assets
2. Avoid duplicate loading of the same assets
3. Handle memory efficiently

### Creating an Asset Manager Class

```cpp
class AssetMgr {
private:
    // Using map with wstring keys for easy asset lookup
    map<wstring, ATexture*> m_mapTex;
    
    // Singleton pattern
    static AssetMgr* m_pInst;
    
public:
    static AssetMgr* GetInst() {
        if (nullptr == m_pInst) {
            m_pInst = new AssetMgr;
        }
        return m_pInst;
    }
    
    ATexture* LoadTexture(const wstring& _Key, const wstring& _RelativePath);
    ATexture* FindTexture(const wstring& _Key);
};

// Implementation example
ATexture* AssetMgr::LoadTexture(const wstring& _Key, const wstring& _RelativePath) {
    // Check if texture already exists
    ATexture* pTexture = FindTexture(_Key);
    if (nullptr != pTexture) {
        return pTexture;  // Return existing texture
    }
    
    // Create new texture
    wstring ContentPath = PathMgr::GetInst()->GetContentPath();
    ATexture* pNewTex = new ATexture;
    
    // Load texture from file
    if (!pNewTex->Load(ContentPath + _RelativePath)) {
        delete pNewTex;
        return nullptr;
    }
    
    // Store in map and return
    m_mapTex.insert(make_pair(_Key, pNewTex));
    return pNewTex;
}
```

## Path Management

Managing file paths is another critical aspect of game development. The `PathMgr` class handles path resolution:

```cpp
class PathMgr {
private:
    wstring m_ContentPath;  // Base path to content folder
    
    // Singleton pattern
    static PathMgr* m_pInst;
    
public:
    static PathMgr* GetInst() {
        if (nullptr == m_pInst) {
            m_pInst = new PathMgr;
        }
        return m_pInst;
    }
    
    const wstring& GetContentPath() { return m_ContentPath; }
    void Init();
};
```

## Data Structures for Game Asset Management

### Using STL Map for Asset Lookup

The notes highlight an important consideration when using maps with string keys:

```cpp
// PROBLEMATIC: Using raw string pointers as keys
map<const wchar_t*, int> mapStrings;
mapStrings.insert(make_pair(L"Hello", 10));
mapStrings.insert(make_pair(L"MyName", 20));

// The issue: This compares pointers, not string contents
```

The problem with using raw string pointers (like `const wchar_t*`) as map keys is that the map compares the pointers themselves, not the string contents. This can lead to unexpected behavior:

```cpp
// These two strings have the same content but different addresses
wchar_t szString[100] = L"Hello";  // On stack
const wchar_t* pString = L"Hello"; // Address to ROM

// This lookup will fail even though the content is "Hello"
auto iter = mapStrings.find(szString);  // Compares addresses, not content
```

### Solution: Using wstring as Map Key

The better approach is to use `wstring` as the key type:

```cpp
// BETTER: Using wstring as the key type
map<wstring, int> mapStrings;
mapStrings.insert(make_pair(L"Hello", 10));

// Now this works correctly, comparing string contents
wchar_t szString[100] = L"Hello";
auto iter = mapStrings.find(szString);  // Finds the entry correctly
```

Using `wstring` ensures that:
1. String content comparisons work correctly (instead of pointer comparisons)
2. The map handles the memory management of the strings
3. Standard operations like alphabetical ordering function properly

## Texture Class Design

A basic texture class for a game might look like:

```cpp
class ATexture {
private:
    HBITMAP m_hBitmap;  // Handle to the bitmap
    HDC     m_hDC;      // Device context for the bitmap
    
    // Make constructor/destructor private if using factory pattern
    ATexture();
    ~ATexture();
    
    // Friend the asset manager to allow it to create textures
    friend class AssetMgr;
    
public:
    bool Load(const wstring& _strFilePath);
    void Render(HDC _dc, int _x, int _y);
};

// Example usage in a game object
class Player {
private:
    ATexture* m_Texture;
    int m_PosX;
    int m_PosY;
    
public:
    void Init() {
        m_Texture = AssetMgr::GetInst()->LoadTexture(L"Fighter", L"Texture\\Fighter.bmp");
    }
    
    void Render(HDC _dc) {
        if (m_Texture) {
            m_Texture->Render(_dc, m_PosX, m_PosY);
        }
    }
};
```

## Compilation and Linking Process

### Headers vs Implementation Files

The notes touch on an important aspect of C++ development: the separation of interface (headers) and implementation (cpp files):

1. **Headers (.h)**: Declare functions, classes, and their interfaces
2. **Implementation (.cpp)**: Contain the actual code that implements those declarations

### Libraries and Linking

When you use functions like `CreateWindow` or `BitBlt`, they're declared in headers but implemented in libraries that are linked during compilation:

```cpp
// Including Windows.h brings in many header files
#include <Windows.h>

// For TransparentBlt, you also need to link to Msimg32.lib
#pragma comment(lib, "Msimg32.lib")
```

This separation allows library creators to:
1. Share functionality without exposing source code
2. Update implementations without requiring users to change their code
3. Distribute binary libraries (.lib files) instead of source code

## Best Practices and Optimization

### 1. Asset Sharing

When multiple game objects use the same texture (e.g., multiple enemies of the same type), load the texture only once and share references:

```cpp
// Instead of loading for each monster
for (auto monster : monsters) {
    // WRONG: Loads multiple copies of the same texture
    monster.texture = new Texture("monster.bmp"); 
}

// CORRECT: Load once and share
ATexture* sharedTexture = AssetMgr::GetInst()->LoadTexture(L"Monster", L"Texture\\monster.bmp");
for (auto monster : monsters) {
    monster.texture = sharedTexture;
}
```

### 2. Double Buffering

The notes mention a "back buffer DC", which refers to double buffering:

1. Render everything to an off-screen buffer (back buffer)
2. Copy the completed frame to the visible screen buffer (front buffer)
3. This prevents visual artifacts and flickering

```cpp
// Create back buffer
HDC backBufferDC = CreateCompatibleDC(mainWindowDC);
HBITMAP backBuffer = CreateCompatibleBitmap(mainWindowDC, windowWidth, windowHeight);
SelectObject(backBufferDC, backBuffer);

// Draw to back buffer
// ... rendering code ...

// Copy to screen in one operation
BitBlt(mainWindowDC, 0, 0, windowWidth, windowHeight, backBufferDC, 0, 0, SRCCOPY);
```

### 3. Memory Management

Always clean up resources when they're no longer needed:

```cpp
// Clean up GDI resources
DeleteObject(hBitmap);
DeleteDC(memDC);
```

## Conclusion

Game programming in C++ with Windows GDI requires a solid understanding of graphics concepts, memory management, and efficient asset handling. By implementing proper texture management, transparency handling, and asset management systems, you can create efficient and maintainable game code.
