# Recursion and Static Variables

## Key Points

- Recursive functions must include a termination condition.
- Iterative and recursive versions of algorithms (e.g., Fibonacci) often differ in efficiency.
- Static variables inside functions retain values across calls.
- Global and local variables with the same name prioritize local scope.
- Use `::` to explicitly access global variables.
- Global, static, and external variables reside in the data segment, not on the stack.

## Overview

This note covers fundamental concepts in C++ involving recursion, Fibonacci sequence implementations, and different types of variables (local, global, static, and extern). The examples illustrate usage patterns and potential tricky cases.

### Recursive Function Example

```cpp
void TestFunc(int _a)
{
    if (_a == 1)    // Termination condition
        return;

    TestFunc(_a - 1);  // Recursive call
}
```
This simple recursive function calls itself until `_a` reaches 1.

### Fibonacci Sequence

#### Iterative Version

```cpp
int Fibonacci(int _N)
{
    if (_N == 1 || _N == 2)
        return 1;

    int n1 = 1;
    int n2 = 1;
    int Value = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < _N - 2; ++i)
    {
        Value = n1 + n2;
        n1 = n2;
        n2 = Value;
    }
    return Value;
}
```
The iterative version avoids stack overhead and performs better.

#### Recursive Version

```cpp
int Fibonacci_Re(int _N)
{
    if (_N == 1 || _N == 2)
        return 1;

    return Fibonacci_Re(_N - 1) + Fibonacci_Re(_N - 2);
}
```
This version is intuitive but inefficient due to repeated calculations.

## Variable Scopes and Types

### Global Variable

```cpp
int g_A = 0;  // Global variable declared in data segment
```
Always exists during program execution. Avoid name collisions.

### Static Variable Inside Function

```cpp
int Test()
{
    static int StaticParam = 0;  // Retains value across calls
    ++StaticParam;
    return StaticParam;
}
```
`StaticParam` is initialized once and keeps its value between function calls.

### Local vs Global Scope

```cpp
int Test()
{
    int g_A = 0;      // Local variable with same name as global
    g_A = 100;        // Refers to local g_A
    ++::g_A;          // Refers to global g_A using scope resolution
    return ::g_A;
}
```
Local variable hides the global one unless the global is explicitly accessed via `::`.

## Tricky Case: Static Variables and Side Effects

Calling a function with static variables multiple times results in state accumulation:

```cpp
Test();  // StaticParam becomes 1
Test();  // StaticParam becomes 2
int Count = Test();  // StaticParam becomes 3, Count = 3
```
This makes functions impure and not thread-safe. Use caution in multithreaded or state-dependent scenarios.

## Interview Questions

**Q: What is the difference between a static and global variable?**  
A: Both are stored in the data segment and retain values for the program's lifetime, but static variables are only visible in the scope where they are declared.

**Q: How does tail recursion differ from regular recursion?**  
A: In tail recursion, the recursive call is the last operation, allowing the compiler to optimize it into a loop.

**Q: What happens if a local variable has the same name as a global one?**  
A: The local variable takes precedence. Use `::` to access the global variable explicitly.

**Q: Why avoid recursion for large inputs?**  
A: Recursion can cause stack overflows and is generally less efficient than iteration for large input sizes.

## Code Demonstration

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int g_A = 0;

int Test()
{
    static int StaticParam = 0;
    ++StaticParam;
    ++::g_A;
    return ::g_A;
}

int main()
{
    int Arr[100] = {};
    g_A = 20;

    Test();  // g_A becomes 21
    Test();  // g_A becomes 22
    int Count = Test();  // g_A becomes 23, Count = 23

    return 0;
}
```

## Visual: Variable Scopes

| Variable Type   | Memory Area  | Lifetime            | Scope                        |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Local           | Stack        | Until function ends | Current function             |
| Global          | Data Segment | Entire program      | All files (unless static)    |
| Static (local)  | Data Segment | Entire program      | Declaring function only      |
| External        | Data Segment | Entire program      | Across files (with `extern`) |
