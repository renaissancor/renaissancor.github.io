Collision Manager 

CollisionMgr.h cpp file add 
Singleton Mgr

public: 
    CollisionMgr(); 
    ~CollisionMgr(); 

inside enum.h 
ACTOR_TYPE 
{
    DEFAULT, 
    BACKGROUND, 
    TILE, 
    PLAYER, 
    ENEMY, 
    ... 
    ACTOR_EHD = 32, 
}

Collision Manager Matrix num is total ACTOR_END 
unsigned int m_Matrix[ACTOR_END]; 
Why? this is row col 

32 X 32 Matrix is generated 
4 Byte 

We are trying to make collision manager 
now actor type classified, several actors exist 
but now they are 

Inside Collision Manager, record 
Collision check inside 32 X 32 matrix, 
actor type total 
index check [col][row] and [row][col] will return same 
0 to 31 actor types 

DEFAULT = 0, 
UI = 31, 
ACTOR_END = 32,  

So either check row col or col row would be symmetric 
So we are going to use only half of thee entire matrix 
center part will be col == row 
Sometimes same group actor might collide together 

Suppose 

So indexing should be 
x = 열 = horizontal location = vertical column number = col idx 
y = 행 = vertical location = horizontal row number = row idx  
x index bigger y index smaller to use only left upper half triangle 
col idx bigger row idx  smaller 

Index based access unsigned int 

Collision Check Box UI checking v or re pressing check ? 
bit value input 

Bit 
If bit value is 0 then turn it as 1 
m_Matrix[Row] ^= (1 << col); 

void CollisionCheck(ACTOR_TYPE _Left, ACTOR_TYPE _Right, bool _Check)
{
    UINT Row = _Left; 
    UINT Col = _Right; 


    if(_Check)
        m_Matrix[Row] |= (1 << Col); 
    else
        m_Matrix[Row] &= ~(1 << Col);  

}
// This it bit masking based 

Clear all 
for(UINT i = 0; i < ACTOR_TYPE::ACTOR_END; ++i)
{
    m_Matrix[i] = 0; 
}
// aka 
memset(m_Matrix, 0, sizeof(UINT) * ACTOR_END); 
void Tick(); 

Collision Manager inside Engine 
Collisoin Check after TimeMgr KeyMgr LevelMgr Tick 

Total 32 X 32 Matrix for loop to check collision 
for(UINT Row = 0; Row < ACTOR_END; ++row)
{
    for(UINT Col = Row; Col < ACTOR_END, ++Col){ // Only use half of matrix to check collision 
        if(m_Matrix[Row] & (1 << Col)){
            // if You mark during debug by F5 and collision happens debug will check here 
            CollisionActor((ACTOR_TYPE) Row, (ACTOR_TYPE) Col) 
        }
    }
}

void CollisionActor(ACTOR_TYPE _Row, ACTOR_TPYE _Col)

If you have hundreds of actors then collision check should happen a lot 
100 99 98 ... 1 Collision check 

To prevent this, actor classification

vector<Collider*> m_vecCollider[ACTOR_END]; 

void RegisterCollider(Collider *Collider); 

Player Actor Final Tick 

If player onned collider final tick 

Collider FinalTick 
m_FinalPos = GetOwner()->GetPos() + m_OffsetPos 

Actor Type 
Actor itself should recognize what actor type it has
Actor Component 
what Actor type you are..? So, Actor also should get 
what ACTOR_TYPE it is in the virtual Actor class, and if not belonged 
m_ACtorType((ACTOR_TYPE) -1); // Not generated 

If Actor without initialization then 
Level Actor 
void AddActor also should let its index known what type it is 

ACTOR_TYPE GetActorType() return m_ActorType; 
then Collider will also know what Actor type its owner have 
Enemy layer collider vector 

Collision 
So all Colliders registered ... 

CollisionMgr 
Tick C

For last execution clear all Colliders inside Tick 
register per each tick 
what if one object is deleted? Object is kept refreshed over and over 
no need to refresh 
Player Monster Enemy 
Collision one by one check? 

CollisionMgr 
CollisionActor 

Should know whether collision happened previoulsyl among a lot of colliders 

If Collision happens a lot, since a lot of Actors 
We need id for collision 

All Components are Base inherited so they all have not same ID  
Collision Manager keywords struct class union etc 
union COLLIER_ID  {
    unsigned long long ID; // 8 byte integer 
    struct{ // total 8 byte 
        UINT left; // 4 byte  
        UINT right;  // 4 byte 
    }
}; // Share Memory based on its largest data type 
Union declarecd case memory structure will be 
memory 8 bytes integer ID and Left Right also SHARED! 
SAME Space is reprsented with different name 
unsinged long long ID is also accessible with half as Left and half as Right, into same space 

COLLIDER_ID ColID = {}; 
ColID.Left  = m_vecCollider[_Row][i]->GetID(); 
ColID.Right = m_vecCollider[_Row][j]->GetID();
Collision of unique id made is 
unique 8 byte id possible to make by two Colliders with their own unique id. 

DWORD_PTR ID ; // unsigned long long 
map<DWORD_PTR, bool> m_ColInfo; // Recording Collision mhappening 

map<DWORD_PTR, bool>:: iterator iter = m_ColInfo.find(ColID.ID); 
If (iter == m_ColInfo.end()) // Does not exist 
{
    m_ColInfo.insert(make_pair(ColId.ID, false)); // Not existing two colliders combiination 
    iter = m_ColInfo.find(ColID.ID); 
}
iter->second; // Whether previously collided or not, if this is true collision happened last frame, false means collision did not happen 

if(IsOverlap(m_vecCollider[_Row][i],m_vecCollider[_Col_][j] ))
if previously not collied, meaning this is first collision so begin overlap 
Overlap function call 
else // It was separated before 
BeginOverlap function call 

else 
it was previously in overlap 
then call 
EndOverlap function 
iter->second = true; or false 

int m_OverlapCount; // 

Overlaps 
Player::BeginOverlap
Player::Overlap 
PlayeR::EndOverlap 
For all Actors 
Monster::BeginOverlap etc ... 
Suppose player shoots something 

Actor Missile 
class Missile : public Actor 
private:  
public: 

Missile(); 
virtual ~Missile() override; 

float m_Speed; // Missile Speed 
float m_Angle; // Missile Moving direction 

Missile will also have it scollider 

class Collider; // Predeclaration 

Collider *m_Collider; 

TimeMgr 
GetPos 
vPos.y -= m_Speed * DT; 
Ellipse draw 

Shoot when player press space in tick 

Missile is created 
inside DT Tick FinalTick and Render 
Suppose Missile is generated 
but even though you generate missile inside 
if loop has not added 

Tick will NOT be called and Finaltick will be called 
Some object might be ambiguous 

If you are going to make missile in this tick, then 
suppose that new actor Missile will exist AFTER this tick 
so taht it will only execute FinalTick and Render 

Level if something is newly created it should work for next frame not this frame 
so we are going to make it as 
EventMgr or TaskMgr. 
And next frame will execute  

Now Player Tick will register event my Actor creation of Missile inside its Tick 
ACTOR is removed from memory?  
Level Change how? Stage change inside game?

Also you can make several Levels and switch level 

enum class EVENT
{
    CREATE_ACTOR 
    DESTROY_ACTOR 
    CHANGE_LEVEL 
}

m_vecEvent.clear(); 

Now missile creation is right after 1 frame of space pressing frame 

Similarly object deleting 
When monster get hit by missile let missile to be deleted 

if EventMgr directly delete after the DT tick finaltick render execution 
vector Actor Tick FinalTick Render 
Monster Player Actor Address 

Mark certain Actor as "Dead" for more safer allocation. It should be supposed as deleted, 
but for safer memory release it will be marked as just dead in the first frame 
and will be deleted in the second frame for dead marked 
finally for third frame it will not exist anymore inside memory 

Inside EventMgr, make vector<*Actor> m_Garbage 
make their status as dead and push inside EventMgr garbage can 
Event Manager Trashcan now next frame while dead execute one more frame 

LevelMgr Tick FinalTick Render ... 
some Actor might be Dead state! then, 
Tick and FinalTick will still be called 

Clear Garbage before 

Dead status even call Tick and FinalTick, and 
CollisionMgr will check 

So add another collision condition 
bool IsDead 
m_vecCollider[_Row][i]->GetOwner()->IsDead() ||  
m_vecCollider[_Col][i]->GetOwner()->IsDead() 
Among all colliders, if one of Owner Actor of the each collider is 
Colliding now and collided before 

If isDead is true then ? 
else 

If colliding now and it was previously separated ? 

Dual free problem prevention to put same Actor pointer into Garbage as dead 
by putting loop inside Actor 

You have collsion flipbook animation, so simple game is now possible to generate!
