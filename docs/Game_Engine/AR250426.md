# Windows API Programming

## Introduction

Understanding Windows API programming is essential for C++ game developers working in the Windows environment. This article breaks down fundamental concepts of Windows application development including process handling, window creation, resource management, and message loops. These concepts form the foundation of Windows desktop application development and are particularly relevant for game development.

## Process Handles and Instances

When developing Windows applications, understanding process handles and instances is crucial. Here's what you need to know:

### HINSTANCE and Process IDs

- `HINSTANCE` represents a handle to an instance, which is essentially the launched process ID.
- When you start a program like `mspaint.exe` multiple times, each instance gets its own process ID.

### Multiple Instance Detection

In older Windows systems, you could detect previous instances using:

```cpp
__IN_ HINSTANCE hInstance       // Current process ID 
_In_opt_ HINSTANCE hPrevInstance // Previous instance handle
```

If you wanted to prevent multiple launches of your application (common in game clients):

```cpp
if(nullptr != hPrevInstance) {
    // Another instance exists
    return 0; // Terminate this instance
}
```

However, this mechanism is obsolete in modern Windows. Each process now operates in its own virtual memory space (approximately 150-180 MB of RAM), and Windows OS manages memory mapping. This means processes can't easily find or access each other even if they're instances of the same executable.

## Resource Management

Resources are non-executable data included with your application, such as strings, icons, and menus.

### String Tables

String tables let you store text values in your application's resources:

```
IDS_APP_TITLE    103    WinAPI_56  
IDC_WINAPI56     109    WinAPI_56
```

These values can be accessed in code using:

```cpp
LoadStringW(hInstance, IDS_APP_TITLE, szTitle, 100);
```

When an application launches:
1. The process is loaded into memory
2. Resources (including string tables) are loaded with it
3. Resource values can be accessed via their IDs

### Why Use Resource Strings?

While it's possible to hardcode strings directly:

```cpp
wchar_t szWindowClass[100] = L"WINAPI_56";
```

Resources provide several advantages:
- Centralized management of strings
- Easier localization
- Separation of code and content

## Window Registration and Creation

Creating windows involves two key steps: registering a window class and instantiating windows of that class.

### Window Class Registration

```cpp
WNDCLASSEXW wcex;
// Fill window class options
wcex.lpszClassName = szWindowClass; // Class name (key value)
RegisterClassExW(&wcex);
```

This registers a "blueprint" for your windows, defining their behavior and appearance. The `lpszClassName` acts as a key that identifies this window type.

### Window Creation

```cpp
HWND hWnd = CreateWindow(szWindowClass, szTitle, ...);
```

Key parameters include:
- Window class name
- Window title
- Style and appearance settings

After creation, windows need to be made visible:

```cpp
ShowWindow(hWnd, nCmdShow); // Make window visible (true) or hidden (false)
UpdateWindow(hWnd);         // Apply the settings
```

### Window Customization

Additional customization options include:
- Menu bars: Set via `wcex.lpszMenuName`
- Icons: Set via `wcex.hIcon`
- Cursors: Set via `wcex.hCursor`

These resources are typically defined in the application's resource files.

## Message Loops and Event Handling

Windows applications are event-driven, using message loops to process user input and system events.

### Message Structure

```cpp
MSG msg = {}; // Structure to hold message information
```

The `MSG` structure holds information about:
- Which window received the event
- What type of event occurred (message ID)
- Additional parameters specific to the event

### Traditional Message Loop

The standard Windows message loop:

```cpp
while(GetMessage(&msg, nullptr, 0, 0)) {
    // Handle shortcut key combinations
    if(!TranslateAccelerator(msg.hwnd, hAccelTable, &msg)) {
        TranslateMessage(&msg); 
        DispatchMessage(&msg);
    }
}
```

This is known as **reactive programming** - the application waits for events and reacts to them.

#### How GetMessage Works

- `GetMessage` retrieves messages from the application's message queue
- If the queue is empty, `GetMessage` pauses execution until a message arrives
- `GetMessage` returns false when it retrieves a `WM_QUIT` message (value 0x0012 or 18 in decimal)
- When false is returned, the loop ends and the application terminates

### Game Programming: PeekMessage Alternative

Games can't just wait for user input - they need to run continuously. Instead of `GetMessage`, games typically use `PeekMessage`:

```cpp
while(running) {
    // Check for messages but don't wait if none exist
    if(PeekMessage(&msg, nullptr, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE)) {
        if(msg.message == WM_QUIT) {
            running = false;
        } else {
            TranslateMessage(&msg);
            DispatchMessage(&msg);
        }
    }
    
    // Game logic runs here, every frame
    UpdateGame();
    RenderFrame();
}
```

The key differences between `GetMessage` and `PeekMessage`:

1. `GetMessage` waits if the message queue is empty; `PeekMessage` returns immediately
2. `GetMessage` returns false for `WM_QUIT`; `PeekMessage` returns true if any message was retrieved
3. `PeekMessage` allows the game loop to run continuously

## Forward Declarations and Global Variables

The code example includes some C/C++ programming concepts worth noting:

### Forward Declarations

```cpp
// Function forward declarations
int Add(int a, int b);
int Sub(int a, int b);
int Mul(int a, int b);
int Div(int a, int b);
```

Forward declarations tell the compiler about functions before they're fully defined, typically in header files.

### Global and Static Variables

```cpp
// Static global variable - only available in this file
static int g_Global = 0;

// Global variable accessible from all files
int g_A = 0;

int main() {
    // Static local variable - retains value between function calls
    static int iStatic = 0;
    
    g_Global = 200;
    //g_A = 100;
    
    // Function calls
    int i = 0;
    i = Add(1, 9);
    i = Sub(1, 9);
    i = Mul(1, 9);
    i = Div(1, 9);
    Func();
    
    return 0;
}
```

- **Static global variables** (prefixed with `static`) are only accessible within the file where they're defined
- **Global variables** without `static` can be accessed from any file (with proper external declarations)
- **Static local variables** retain their values between function calls

## Conclusion

Understanding Windows API programming is essential for C++ game developers targeting the Windows platform. The concepts of process handles, window creation, message loops, and resource management form the foundation of Windows application development. By mastering these concepts, you'll be well-prepared for technical interviews and have the knowledge needed to create efficient, responsive Windows games.

Remember that modern game development often uses frameworks like DirectX, SDL, or game engines that abstract many of these low-level Windows details, but understanding the underlying mechanisms remains valuable for debugging, optimization, and specialized implementation needs.
