# Gaem Engine Delta Time 

## Introduction

This article explores essential concepts in C++ game programming that frequently appear in technical interviews. We'll focus on game engine architecture, class inheritance, polymorphism, and the critical aspect of time management in games. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for building robust game systems and demonstrating proficiency during interviews.

## Game Engine Architecture: The Actor Model

### The Actor Base Class

At the heart of many game engines is the Actor model. An Actor is a base class that represents any object in the game world:

```cpp
class Actor
{
protected:
    Vec2 m_Position;
    Vec2 m_Scale;
    
public:
    // Pure virtual function - making Actor an abstract class
    virtual void Tick() = 0;
    
    // Position getters/setters
    void SetPos(Vec2 _pos) { m_Position = _pos; }
    Vec2 GetPos() { return m_Position; }
    
    // Scale getters/setters
    void SetScale(Vec2 _scale) { m_Scale = _scale; }
    Vec2 GetScale() { return m_Scale; }
};
```

Initially, Actor might be a concrete class with its own implementation of methods like `Tick()`. However, as the engine evolves, Actor typically becomes an abstract class (using the pure virtual function `virtual void Tick() = 0;`). This prevents direct instantiation of the Actor class and requires derived classes to implement their own `Tick()` method.

### Derived Actor Classes

Once Actor becomes an abstract base class, we need to create derived classes to represent specific game entities:

```cpp
class Player : public Actor
{
private:
    // Player-specific properties
    
public:
    // Override the Tick method to implement player-specific behavior
    virtual void Tick() override;
    
    // Additional player-specific methods
};

class Monster : public Actor
{
private:
    // Monster-specific properties
    
public:
    // Override the Tick method to implement monster-specific behavior
    virtual void Tick() override;
    
    // Additional monster-specific methods
};
```

### Polymorphism in Game Design

The Actor model leverages polymorphism, allowing the game engine to treat different types of game objects uniformly while each type maintains its unique behavior:

```cpp
// Inside the Level class that manages game objects
void Level::Tick()
{
    // Loop through all actors and call their Tick method
    for (Actor* actor : m_Actors)
    {
        actor->Tick();  // Polymorphic call - each actor type behaves differently
    }
}
```

This polymorphic approach enables easier management of game objects and more maintainable code.

## The Game Loop and Time Management

### The Problem with Simple Game Loops

A naive implementation of a game loop might look like:

```cpp
while (gameRunning)
{
    ProcessInput();
    UpdateGame();
    RenderFrame();
}
```

However, this approach leads to significant problems:

1. **Performance Variance**: Different computers will run this loop at different speeds
2. **Game Speed Inconsistency**: Game speed becomes directly tied to hardware performance
3. **Screen Flickering**: High frame rates can cause visual artifacts

### The Historical Galaga Case

An interesting historical example is the original Galaga game. As enemies were defeated, the game would run faster because there were fewer objects to process in each frame. This was actually an unintended consequence of the simple game loop design, but players assumed it was a deliberate difficulty increase mechanism! Modern games need to avoid such hardware-dependent behavior.

### Introduction to Delta Time

The solution to these problems is using a time-based approach instead of a frame-based approach. This is where **Delta Time** comes in:

```cpp
// Move player 100 pixels per second, regardless of frame rate
case 'W':
    vPos.y -= 100.f * DT;  // DT = Delta Time (seconds since last frame)
    break;
case 'A':
    vPos.x -= 100.f * DT;
    break;
```

Delta Time represents the time elapsed between frames. By multiplying movement and other time-dependent actions by Delta Time, we ensure consistent behavior regardless of frame rate.

## Implementing a Time Manager

A robust time management system is crucial for any game engine. Let's examine a complete implementation:

### TimeMgr Class Definition

```cpp
// TimeMgr.h
#pragma once
class TimeMgr
{
    SINGLE(TimeMgr)  // Macro for singleton pattern implementation
private:
    LARGE_INTEGER m_Frequency;
    LARGE_INTEGER m_CurCount;
    LARGE_INTEGER m_PrevCount;

    int           m_FrameCount;
    wchar_t       m_String[256];

    float         m_DeltaTime;  // Time taken to complete 1 frame
    float         m_AccTime;    // Accumulated time

public:
    float GetDeltaTime() { return m_DeltaTime; }

public:
    void Tick();
    void Render(HDC _dc);
};
```

### TimeMgr Implementation

```cpp
// TimeMgr.cpp
#include "pch.h"
#include "TimeMgr.h"

TimeMgr::TimeMgr()
    : m_Frequency{}
    , m_CurCount{}
    , m_PrevCount{}
    , m_FrameCount(0)
    , m_String{}
    , m_DeltaTime(0.f)
    , m_AccTime(0.f)
{
    // Get the frequency of the performance counter
    QueryPerformanceFrequency(&m_Frequency);

    // Initialize the previous count
    QueryPerformanceCounter(&m_PrevCount);
}

TimeMgr::~TimeMgr()
{
}

void TimeMgr::Tick()
{
    ++m_FrameCount;

    // Get the current count from the high-precision performance counter
    QueryPerformanceCounter(&m_CurCount);
    
    // Calculate delta time as the time elapsed since last frame
    m_DeltaTime = (float)(m_CurCount.QuadPart - m_PrevCount.QuadPart) / (float)m_Frequency.QuadPart;
            
    // Update previous count for next frame
    m_PrevCount = m_CurCount;

    // Accumulate time for FPS calculation
    m_AccTime += m_DeltaTime;

    // Update frame stats once per second
    if (m_AccTime >= 1.f)
    {    
        swprintf_s(m_String, 256, L"FrameCount : %d, DeltaTime : %f", m_FrameCount, m_DeltaTime);
        m_FrameCount = 0;
        m_AccTime = 0.f;
    }
}

void TimeMgr::Render(HDC _dc)
{
    TextOut(_dc, 10, 10, m_String, wcslen(m_String));
}
```

### High-Precision Timing

For accurate time measurement, the `TimeMgr` class uses Windows' high-precision performance counter:

- `QueryPerformanceFrequency`: Gets the frequency of the counter (ticks per second)
- `QueryPerformanceCounter`: Gets the current counter value

These functions provide much greater precision than alternatives like `GetTickCount()`, which only has millisecond precision (1000 ticks per second). The performance counter typically offers precision in the microsecond range (millions of ticks per second), making it suitable for game timing.

### Using Delta Time in Game Code

Once we have a `TimeMgr` class, we can create a convenient macro to access delta time:

```cpp
// define.h
#define DT TimeMgr::GetInst()->GetDeltaTime()
```

This macro allows easy use of delta time throughout the codebase:

```cpp
// Example player movement with delta time
void Player::Tick()
{
    Vec2 vPos = GetPos();
    
    if (GetAsyncKeyState('W') & 0x8000)
    {
        vPos.y -= 300.f * DT;  // Move 300 pixels per second
    }
    
    if (GetAsyncKeyState('S') & 0x8000)
    {
        vPos.y += 300.f * DT;
    }
    
    // Update position
    SetPos(vPos);
}
```

## Level Management

The Level class is responsible for managing all actors within a game level:

```cpp
// LevelMgr.h
#pragma once

class Level;

class LevelMgr
{
    SINGLE(LevelMgr);
private:
    Level* m_CurLevel;  // Current active level

public:
    void Init();
    void Progress();
};
```

```cpp
// LevelMgr.cpp
#include "pch.h"
#include "LevelMgr.h"

#include "Engine.h"
#include "Level.h"
#include "Player.h"
#include "Monster.h"

LevelMgr::LevelMgr()
    : m_CurLevel(nullptr)
{
}

LevelMgr::~LevelMgr()
{
    if(nullptr != m_CurLevel)
        delete m_CurLevel;
}

void LevelMgr::Init()
{
    m_CurLevel = new Level;

    // Create and configure a Player actor
    Actor* pActor = new Player;    
    pActor->SetPos(Vec2(640, 284));
    pActor->SetScale(Vec2(100, 100));
    m_CurLevel->AddActor(pActor);

    // Create and configure a Monster actor
    pActor = new Monster;
    pActor->SetPos(Vec2(200, 400));
    pActor->SetScale(Vec2(50, 50));
    m_CurLevel->AddActor(pActor);
}

void LevelMgr::Progress()
{
    m_CurLevel->Tick();
    m_CurLevel->Render(Engine::GetInst()->GetMainDC());
}
```

## Putting It All Together: The Game Engine

The game engine ties everything together and manages the main game loop:

```cpp
// Engine.cpp (partial)
void Engine::Progress()
{
    // Update time management system
    TimeMgr::GetInst()->Tick();
    
    // Process the current level
    LevelMgr::GetInst()->Progress();
    
    // Display timing information
    TimeMgr::GetInst()->Render(m_hDC);
}
```

## Common Interview Questions

### 1. What is the purpose of using Delta Time in games?

**Answer**: Delta Time ensures consistent game behavior regardless of frame rate or hardware performance. It represents the time elapsed since the last frame. By multiplying time-dependent actions (like movement) by Delta Time, we ensure that objects move at the same speed regardless of how quickly frames are processed.

### 2. Why should Actor be an abstract class in a game engine?

**Answer**: Making Actor an abstract class (with pure virtual functions) ensures that:
- Developers must implement specific behavior for each game entity type
- The base class provides a common interface for all game objects
- The engine can use polymorphism to simplify game object management
- It prevents instantiation of the generic Actor class, which would lack meaningful behavior

### 3. How would you implement a frame rate limiter in a game engine?

**Answer**: A basic frame rate limiter could be implemented by adding a sleep or wait operation if a frame completes too quickly:

```cpp
void Engine::Progress()
{
    const float targetFrameTime = 1.0f / 60.0f;  // Target 60 FPS
    
    TimeMgr::GetInst()->Tick();  // Start frame timing
    
    // Process game logic
    LevelMgr::GetInst()->Progress();
    
    // Display timing information
    TimeMgr::GetInst()->Render(m_hDC);
    
    // Calculate elapsed time for this frame
    float frameTime = TimeMgr::GetInst()->GetDeltaTime();
    
    // If frame completed too quickly, wait
    if (frameTime < targetFrameTime)
    {
        // Convert to milliseconds
        DWORD sleepTime = (DWORD)((targetFrameTime - frameTime) * 1000.0f);
        if (sleepTime > 0)
            Sleep(sleepTime);
    }
}
```

### 4. What is the difference between `GetTickCount()` and `QueryPerformanceCounter()`?

**Answer**: 
- `GetTickCount()` provides millisecond precision (1000 ticks per second) and is simpler to use.
- `QueryPerformanceCounter()` provides microsecond precision (millions of ticks per second) and is more accurate for measuring small time intervals.
- For games requiring precise timing, `QueryPerformanceCounter()` is the preferred choice.

## Conclusion

Understanding game engine architecture, object-oriented design principles, and time management is fundamental for C++ game development. The concepts covered in this article—Actor model, polymorphism, delta time, and high-precision timing—form the foundation of most modern game engines.

For game programming interviews, be prepared to discuss these topics in depth and demonstrate how they contribute to creating robust, platform-independent game systems. Remember that a well-designed architecture not only makes your game run consistently across different hardware but also simplifies development and maintenance as your game grows in complexity.
