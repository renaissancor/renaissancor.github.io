Access to current level by LevelMgr.h and Level.h include 
access to current level and borrwo actor type data all actors 

Level pCurrentLevel = LevelMgr::Get GetCurrentLevel 
pCurLevel->GetActor 
GetActor return by vector<Actor*> GetActor 
but this way ... it is temporal generation of vector, 
so refereence is recommended so that only 
but this way it is read only purpose so final function will be 
const vector<Actor*> &GetActor (ACTOR_TYPE Type)

// In missile side receive by 
const vector<Actor*> vecActor = pCurLevel->GetActor(m_TargetType)

for(size_t i = 0; i < vecActor.size(); ++i) 

Vec2 GetPos(); 

float Distance(Vec2 _Other){
    sqrt (
    (x - _Other.x) * (x - _Other.x) + 
    (y - _Other.y) * (y - _Other.y)
    ) 
}

Missile itself and find distance for each moster class 

float m_DetectRange; // During Find Target 

DrawDebugCircle(GetPos(), m_DetectRange, PEN_TYPE::BLUE, 0.f)
This debugger will be used 

// If Target not found, go into original direction 
if(m_Target == nullptr) Move_DireVector(); 
else 

DrawDebugCircle(GetPos(), m_DetectRange, )

const vector<Actor*> 

to get angle between missile and target object, 
use arc cos and arc sin functions 
acosf 
asinf 

however if you use arc cosine out of  0 to pi then it will return error, so 
it is limited input from 0 to pi 

So exceptional case is required when theta is above pi value 
GetPos().x 

so basically pre processing of Radian value to become input of acosf and asinf should be 
vpos.x += _m_Speed. x 

class Camera 

Camera rendering position render 

Actor will get 
GetRenderPos function 

Now all of them when rendered, GetRenderPos () will be done 

Camera Movement 

Go to KeyMgr and add 
LEFT RIGHT UP DOWN 
to use it for camera movement 

VK_LEFT
VK_RIGHT
VK_TOP
VK_DOWN 

setup camera speed 

DebugRender too 
Rendering Position is based on camera and temporal relative value 

GetRenderPos 

Tick 
Camera 
Move Camera 
Camera Oscillation 

void CalcDiff(); 

Camera Oscillation 
Frequency per second represents 
y axis change upward and downward cycle per second 
Delta Time Difference 

float fMove = m_Amplitude * 4.f * m_Frequency * DT; // Camera y axis this frame movement amouunt  
How much offset movement should be odne 
m_OffsetLook.y += fMove; 

// This frame camera offset change 

offset look change 


Alpha Blending 
What you want about color 
Currently inside pixel RGB 
Mix the color you want to mix and original pixel data file have 

Suppose RGB in some pixel 200 30 30 Narly Red color 
You want to cover its RGB to somewhat color like 30 20 220  
Then, multiply each by half and mix them 
So the cconsequence will be 
230 / 2 , 50 / 2 , 250 / 2 so that in consequence 
115 25 125 as an average value so in result it will be somewhat purple 

Alpha Blend generally means Alpha means opaquity or hallow, or empty 
so one pixel will include R G B A, where A represents how opaque it is. 
A value 255 represents it is not opaque
A value 0 represents it is opaque 

But currently my rendering is based on OpenGL, then how? 

Alpha value is zero, 

Each value of RGB will be multiplied by Alpha value which is generally float between 0 and 1 

WinAPI Alpha Blendin gfunctions 

blend.AlphaFormat = AC_SRC_ALPHA; // Important 
blend.SourceConstantAlpha = 255 // Important 
blend.BlendFrags // Not really useful  
blend.BlendOp // Same, not really useful 

If you load image in photoshop 
you have alpha channel, you can see alpha value 
light part alpha 255 and black part alpha 0 vallue 

Tha is why in bmp file magenta pixel, 
render by AlphaBlending from TransparentBlt returns gray value 

When Alpha Channel does not exist in the file then 
AlphaFormat should be set as 0 

Since there is no alpha channel usage so it will be same as BitBlt or TranasparentBlt 
if AlphaFormat setup is 0 instead of AC_SRC_ALPHA 

SourceConstantAlpha means More Alpha value impllication. 
If SourceConstantAlpha, the global Alpha variable applied. 
So blend.SourceConstantAlpha = 0 will make all rendering completely opaque 
while about SourceConstantAlpha = 127 will make half opaque for all GDI AlphaBlend rendered objects

If you want to make alpha blending to bmp file then you can just add 
originally existing RGB to Alpha channel by adding new channel 
and then in photoshop Set Only Magenta Area by clicking all space by 
 Ctrl Shift I 
 Put Alt Delete 
 and let Character value have Alpha value only 
 Now 32Bit Texture bmp file with Alpha blending channel 
 from 24 Bit texture bmp file without Alpha channel 

 And Now you can apply additional alpha blending globally by SourceConstantAlpha 

 in Class Monster::Public Actor 

 float m_Alpha; 

Alpha Blending from 0 to 1  then blink might get implemented 
or let rendered graphics fade away slowly for dead monster 

png file 
png file includes alpha application 


Then ... How about OpenGL Alpha Blending ? 

So we should borrow alpha value from png 
Asset -> Texture -> Loading 
now Texture loading will include 
wchar_t szExt[50] = {}; 

_wsplitppath_s(_FilePath.c_str(), nullptr, 0, nullptr, 0, nullptr, 0, szExt, 50); 
This will likely to get the last part  
wstring strExt = szExt; 
if(strExt == L".bmp" || strExt == L".BMP")

bmp file case bitmap data bitmap DC connect ... 

else if(strExt == L".png" || strExt == L".PNG")

#include <objidl.h>
#include <gdiplus.h> 
#pragma comment(lib, "Gdiplus.lib")
using namespace Gdiplus; 


Original file texture loading 

HDC HBitMap 
Engine holds texture slide 

Now Create Texture based on resolution 
void ATexture::Create(UINT width, UINT height)
m_BackBufferBlt 

Texture class hBitMap and m_hDC created 
DeleteObject 
GetObject 

Texture Generation by pNewTex->Create without any original file for now. 
Now Engine does not require any backbuffer texture 

RenderMgr 

return BackBuffer itself instead of BackbufferDC but my rendering is done by OpenGL now 

Now backbuffer texture will be deleted by assetMgr 

Camera Singleton Camera texture asset manager request create texture 
Engine::Getnst

Screen generation resolution same as texture 
Now Camera will have one texture  
Camera Render 

Pixel count 1024 768 
if alpha value is zero, no need to print, but camera internally render camera effect 
Frame drop is significant 

if alpha value is less than or equal to zero do not render, 
fade in out effect inside camera when alpha value is nearly zero but still not below or equal zero 
the Render function might stiill continue per each tick despite of 
if (m_CamEffectAlpha <= 0.f) return; // This circumstance 
Alpha value 

DT FADE_IN OUT 0.f 
so lets suppose that if duration is less than curtime set m_CamEffectAlpha as 0.f completely 
so when range reaches setup remanining value clearly into 0.f or 1.f 


Rigid Body Component 

Current Destination, unavoidable missile 
two missiles if monster move next frame then 
direction vector time 
angle rotation is also supposed to be changed marginally for smoother path to move close to target 
Per Second, DT Frmae, move per each frame 
Not able to find instantly, missile will moee quite in somewhat circular direction 

So, movement of projectile will be more ... realistic and angle change is more slower 
Rotation direction setup Clockwise or counterclockwise
