# Level Management and Resource Handling

## Introduction

Game engine architecture is a critical aspect of game development that requires careful consideration to ensure optimal performance, maintainability, and scalability. This article explores key components of a game engine with a focus on level management, resource handling, client-server architecture, and efficient rendering techniques. These concepts are fundamental knowledge for any C++ game programmer interview.

## Client-Server Architecture in Games

Before diving into the engine architecture, it's important to understand the client-server model, which influences many design decisions in multiplayer game development.

### Basic Client-Server Interaction

In multiplayer games, particularly FPS (First Person Shooter) games, the server typically maintains the authoritative game state, while clients receive and visualize this information. This architecture has several implications:

- The server maintains and distributes information about all players to each client
- Each client already contains information about other players (enemies)
- Clients are primarily responsible for rendering the game state received from the server

### Handling Game Actions and Anti-Cheat Considerations

When a player performs an action like shooting, the process typically follows these steps:

1. The client detects the action (e.g., gun fired)
2. Client-side collision detection determines what was hit
3. The client sends this information to the server
4. The server validates the action before applying it to the game state

This separation of responsibilities creates vulnerabilities for cheating. For example, a modified client could:

- Ignore obstacles in collision detection
- Report false hits on enemies
- Manipulate player position data

To mitigate these risks, proper server-side validation is crucial. In many competitive games, the server performs its own collision detection and validation rather than trusting client reports.

```cpp
// Example of how a server might validate a hit report
bool ServerValidateHit(const BulletInfo& bullet, const PlayerPosition& shooterPos, 
                       const PlayerPosition& targetPos) {
    // Check if line of sight exists between shooter and target
    if (!HasLineOfSight(shooterPos, targetPos)) {
        return false; // No line of sight, reject the hit
    }
    
    // Check if bullet trajectory matches reported hit
    if (!IsTrajectoryValid(bullet, shooterPos, targetPos)) {
        return false; // Invalid trajectory, reject the hit
    }
    
    return true; // Hit validated
}
```

For some games, particularly non-competitive or console games, extensive anti-cheat measures may be less critical due to:
- The limited impact of cheating in cooperative or single-player experiences
- More controlled hardware environments (e.g., consoles) that make cheating difficult

## GDI Resource Management

Moving to our engine implementation, proper management of GDI (Graphics Device Interface) resources is essential for rendering efficiency.

### Enumerating Common Resources

To efficiently manage graphical resources like pens and brushes, we can use enumerations:

```cpp
#pragma once

enum class PEN_TYPE
{
    RED,
    BLUE,
    GREEN,
    GRAY,
    BLACK,
    WHITE,
    MAGENTA,
    END, // Marker for the total number of pens
};

enum class BRUSH_TYPE
{
    RED,
    BLUE,
    GREEN,
    GRAY,
    MAGENTA,
    HOLLOW,
    END
};
```

### Creating and Managing GDI Objects

These resources are created once at initialization and stored for reuse:

```cpp
// Declaration in the engine class
HPEN m_pen[(UINT)PEN_TYPE::END];
HBRUSH m_brush[(UINT)BRUSH_TYPE::END];

// Creation of resources
void Engine::CreateGDIObjects()
{
    m_pen[(UINT)PEN_TYPE::RED] = CreatePen(PS_SOLID, 1, RGB(255, 0, 0));
    m_pen[(UINT)PEN_TYPE::GREEN] = CreatePen(PS_SOLID, 1, RGB(0, 255, 0));
    m_pen[(UINT)PEN_TYPE::BLUE] = CreatePen(PS_SOLID, 1, RGB(0, 0, 255));
    m_pen[(UINT)PEN_TYPE::MAGENTA] = CreatePen(PS_SOLID, 1, RGB(255, 0, 255));
    // Other pens...
    
    m_brush[(UINT)BRUSH_TYPE::RED] = CreateSolidBrush(RGB(255, 0, 0));
    // Other brushes...
    
    // The HOLLOW brush is obtained from the system
    m_brush[(UINT)BRUSH_TYPE::HOLLOW] = (HBRUSH)GetStockObject(HOLLOW_BRUSH);
}
```

### Proper Resource Cleanup

Cleaning up these resources when the engine shuts down is equally important:

```cpp
void Engine::CleanupGDIObjects()
{
    // Release the device context
    ReleaseDC(m_hMainWnd, m_MainDC);
    
    // Delete all pens
    for(UINT i = 0; i < (UINT)PEN_TYPE::END; ++i) {
        DeleteObject(m_pen[i]);
    }
    
    // Delete all brushes except HOLLOW (system-managed)
    for(UINT i = 0; i < (UINT)BRUSH_TYPE::END; ++i) {
        if(i == (UINT)BRUSH_TYPE::HOLLOW) continue;
        DeleteObject(m_brush[i]);
    }
}
```

### Accessor Methods

To provide access to these resources, we implement simple getter methods:

```cpp
HPEN Engine::GetPen(PEN_TYPE _Type)
{
    return m_pen[(UINT)_Type];
}

HBRUSH Engine::GetBrush(BRUSH_TYPE _Type)
{
    return m_brush[(UINT)_Type];
}
```

## Level Management Architecture

Level management is a core component of game engines, responsible for organizing game stages and maintaining collections of actors.

### Level Class Design

The Level class serves as a container for all actors in a game stage:

```cpp
class Level
{
private:
    vector<Actor*> m_vecActor; // Collection of actors in this level
    
public:
    void Tick();         // Update all actors
    void Render(HDC _dc); // Render all actors
    void AddActor(Actor* _actor); // Add an actor to the level
    
public:
    Level();
    ~Level();
};
```

### Level Manager Implementation

The Level Manager controls which level is currently active and facilitates level transitions:

```cpp
#pragma once

class Level;

class LevelMgr
{
    SINGLE(LevelMgr); // Singleton macro
private:
    Level* m_CurLevel; // Currently active level

public:
    void Init();
    void Progress();
};
```

Implementation in LevelMgr.cpp:

```cpp
#include "pch.h"
#include "LevelMgr.h"

#include "Engine.h"
#include "Level.h"
#include "Actor.h"

LevelMgr::LevelMgr()
    : m_CurLevel(nullptr)
{

}

LevelMgr::~LevelMgr()
{
    if(nullptr != m_CurLevel)
       delete m_CurLevel;
}

void LevelMgr::Init()
{
    m_CurLevel = new Level;

    Actor* pActor = new Actor; 
    pActor->SetPos(Vec2(640, 284));
    pActor->SetScale(Vec2(100, 100));
    m_CurLevel->AddActor(pActor);

    pActor = new Actor;
    pActor->SetPos(Vec2(200, 400));
    pActor->SetScale(Vec2(50, 50));
    m_CurLevel->AddActor(pActor);
}

void LevelMgr::Progress()
{
    m_CurLevel->Tick();
    m_CurLevel->Render(Engine::GetInst()->GetMainDC());
}
```

## Forward Declaration and Header Management

Proper management of header files is crucial for optimizing compilation time and avoiding circular dependencies.

### The Value of Forward Declarations

In the LevelMgr.h file, notice the use of a forward declaration:

```cpp
class Level; // Forward declaration
```

This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Reduced Compilation Time**: When a header file changes, only files that directly include it need to be recompiled, not those that use forward declarations.

2. **Prevents Circular Dependencies**: Forward declarations help break potential circular include dependencies.

3. **Minimized Header Coupling**: Implementation details remain hidden from header files.

### Guidelines for Header Management

For optimal compilation performance:

1. Use forward declarations in header files when possible
2. Include the actual headers only in .cpp files where needed
3. Keep header files minimal and focused

```cpp
// Good practice
// In header file
class SomeClass; // Forward declaration

// In cpp file
#include "SomeClass.h"
```

## Actor Collection Management

Efficient storage and access to game objects is crucial for performance.

### Container Selection: Vector vs. Linked List

Both arrays/vectors and linked lists have O(n) time complexity for iterating through all elements, but there are practical performance differences:

- **Dynamic Arrays/Vectors**: Better cache locality and fewer memory allocations make iteration faster in practice
- **Linked Lists**: Each node access requires a pointer dereference, increasing the actual work done during iteration

For a game where actors are iterated over every frame, a vector is typically the better choice:

```cpp
class Level
{
private:
    vector<Actor*> m_vecActor; // Vector of actor pointers
    
    // Methods...
};
```

### Memory Management for Actor Collections

When a level contains dynamically allocated actors, proper cleanup is essential:

```cpp
Level::~Level()
{
    // Clean up all dynamically allocated actors
    for (size_t i = 0; i < m_vecActor.size(); ++i)
    {
        delete m_vecActor[i];
    }
    
    // Vector's own destructor will handle clearing its internal storage
}
```

## Polymorphism and Virtual Destructors

When using polymorphism with actor hierarchies, proper virtual destructor implementation is critical.

### The Need for Virtual Destructors

Consider this hierarchy:
- Actor (base class)
  - Player (derived class)
  - Enemy (derived class)

When storing these as base class pointers:

```cpp
vector<Actor*> m_vecActor; // Contains Player* and Enemy* stored as Actor*
```

Without a virtual destructor, deleting through the base pointer will only call the base class destructor:

```cpp
// If Actor's destructor is not virtual
delete someActorPointer; // Only calls ~Actor(), not ~Player() or ~Enemy()
```

### Implementing Virtual Destructors

The solution is to declare the base class destructor as virtual:

```cpp
class Actor 
{
public:
    // Other members...
    
    virtual ~Actor() {} // Virtual destructor ensures proper cleanup
};
```

With this change, the appropriate derived class destructor will be called first, followed by the base class destructor, ensuring complete cleanup.

## Interview Questions

Here are some challenging interview questions related to these concepts:

1. **Q: Why should you prefer using a vector over a linked list for storing game actors that need to be updated every frame?**  
   A: Although both have O(n) theoretical complexity for iteration, vectors offer better cache locality and fewer pointer dereferences, making them significantly faster for sequential access patterns common in game loops.

2. **Q: What is the purpose of forward declarations and when should you use them?**  
   A: Forward declarations tell the compiler that a class exists without defining its structure. They should be used in header files when you only need pointers or references to a class, helping to reduce compilation dependencies and improve build times.

3. **Q: Why is it crucial to declare destructors as virtual in base classes used for polymorphism?**  
   A: When deleting objects through base class pointers, only the base class destructor will be called unless it's declared virtual. Virtual destructors ensure that the appropriate derived class destructor is called first, followed by the base class destructor, preventing memory leaks.

4. **Q: In a client-server game architecture, what validation should the server perform to prevent cheating?**  
   A: The server should validate player positions, verify line-of-sight for attacks, perform its own collision detection, and check the plausibility of reported actions. Never trust client-reported data for game-critical decisions.

5. **Q: How would you optimize GDI resource management in a Windows-based game?**  
   A: Create common GDI resources (pens, brushes) once at initialization and store them for reuse. Use enumerations to organize and access them. Ensure proper cleanup when the application exits to prevent resource leaks.

6. **Q: How would you implement a level transition system in your game engine?**  
   A: The Level Manager should handle creating new levels, destroying old ones, and managing the transition between them. This might involve fading screens, loading new assets, and ensuring all resources from the previous level are properly cleaned up.

## Conclusion

Understanding these fundamental aspects of game engine architecture is essential for building efficient, maintainable games. From resource management to level organization, these principles form the foundation of well-designed game systems. Proper understanding of polymorphism, memory management, and optimization techniques will help you create robust game engines and perform well in technical interviews.
