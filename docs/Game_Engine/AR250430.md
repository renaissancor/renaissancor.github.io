# WinAPI Actor Architecture and Rendering 

## Introduction to Actor-Based Design

In game development, effective architecture is crucial for creating maintainable and scalable systems. One of the most widespread patterns is the actor-based architecture, which serves as the foundation for many modern game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity.

## Understanding Actors as Foundational Elements

An Actor represents the minimum material unit in a game world. Rather than creating all game objects directly, we define a base Actor class from which more specific classes are derived. This approach leverages C++ polymorphism to create a flexible and extensible game architecture.

The Actor base class typically cannot be instantiated directly - it's designed as an abstract class that provides common functionality while requiring derived classes to implement specific behaviors. This follows the principle that concrete objects in a game world are always specific entities (Player, Monster, Prop, etc.) rather than generic "actors."

## Basic Actor Implementation

Let's examine a fundamental Actor class implementation:

```cpp
class Actor 
{
private: 
    // Position and scale represented as vectors
    Vec2 m_Pos;
    Vec2 m_Scale;

public: 
    // Position setter and getter
    void SetPos(Vec2 _Pos)
    {
        m_Pos = _Pos; 
    }

    // Scale setter and getter
    void SetScale(Vec2 _Scale)
    {
        m_Scale = _Scale; 
    }

    Vec2 GetPos()
    {
        return m_Pos; 
    }

    Vec2 GetScale()
    {
        return m_Scale; 
    }
    
    // Core functionality that all actors must implement
    virtual void Tick() = 0;
    virtual void Render(HDC _dc);
};
```

## Header Implementation and Inline Functions

A critical point to understand about the above implementation is the implications of defining functions within the header file. When functions are defined (implemented) directly in a header file, they are implicitly treated as inline functions.

### What are Inline Functions?

Inline functions are a compiler optimization where the function's code is inserted directly at the call site rather than generating an actual function call. This can improve performance for small, frequently called functions by eliminating the overhead of the function call mechanism.

When a function is defined in a header file:

1. The compiler treats it as an inline function
2. The function's implementation is copied wherever it's called
3. No separate function call is generated in the compiled code

For example, when we call:

```cpp
actor.SetPos(Vec2{10.0f, 10.0f});
```

The compiler effectively transforms this into:

```cpp
actor.m_Pos = Vec2{10.0f, 10.0f};
```

This avoids the overhead of a function call, which includes:
- Pushing parameters onto the stack
- Jumping to the function code
- Setting up the function's stack frame
- Returning from the function
- Cleaning up the stack

### When to Use Inline Functions

Inline functions are particularly beneficial when:
1. The function is small and simple
2. The function is called frequently
3. The function execution time is comparable to or less than the function call overhead

Simple accessors and mutators (getters and setters) are excellent candidates for inline functions because they typically just return or assign a value.

### Cautions with Inline Functions

There are trade-offs to consider:

1. **Code Size Increase**: Every place the function is called will contain a copy of the function code, potentially increasing the executable size
2. **Header File Bloat**: Implementing complex functions in the header can make headers large and difficult to maintain
3. **Compilation Time**: Changes to inline functions require recompiling all files that include the header

For larger, more complex functions, it's generally better to provide only the declaration in the header and implement the function in a .cpp file.

## Custom Vector Implementation

For better precision in positioning and movement, we can implement a custom vector structure using floating-point values instead of integers:

```cpp
struct Vec2 {
    float x;
    float y;

public: 
    // Default constructor initializes to zero
    Vec2() : x(0.f), y(0.f) {}
    
    // Parameterized constructor
    Vec2(float _x, float _y) : x(_x), y(_y) {}
};
```

Using floating-point values allows for smoother movement and more precise positioning than integer-based coordinates, which is especially important for game development where sub-pixel precision may be needed.

## The Game Loop: Tick and Render

In game development, a fundamental concept is the game loop, often divided into update (Tick) and rendering phases.

### The Tick Function

The `Tick()` function is called once per frame and is responsible for updating an actor's state, handling input, applying physics, and any other frame-by-frame logic. All actors must implement their own Tick function:

```cpp
// In the Actor base class
virtual void Tick() = 0; // Pure virtual function

// In a derived class (e.g., Player)
void Player::Tick() override {
    // Check for input
    if(GetAsyncKeyState('W')) {
        m_Pos.y -= 0.001f; // Move up slightly
    }
    if(GetAsyncKeyState('S')) {
        m_Pos.y += 0.001f; // Move down slightly
    }
    if(GetAsyncKeyState('A')) {
        m_Pos.x -= 0.001f; // Move left slightly
    }
    if(GetAsyncKeyState('D')) {
        m_Pos.x += 0.001f; // Move right slightly
    }
    
    // Additional actor-specific logic
}
```

### The Render Function

The `Render()` function is responsible for drawing the actor on the screen. While the base Actor class may provide a default implementation, derived classes often override it for custom visuals:

```cpp
void Actor::Render(HDC _dc) {
    // Calculate rectangle corners based on position and scale
    Rectangle(_dc, 
            (int)(m_Pos.x - m_Scale.x / 2), 
            (int)(m_Pos.y - m_Scale.y / 2),
            (int)(m_Pos.x + m_Scale.x / 2), 
            (int)(m_Pos.y + m_Scale.y / 2));
}
```

## Input Handling in Games

A key aspect of interactive games is handling user input. While Windows typically processes input through the message loop (WM_KEYDOWN, WM_KEYUP, etc.), games often need more immediate input detection.

### Asynchronous Key State Detection

For responsive input handling, games commonly use the `GetAsyncKeyState()` function, which checks the current state of a key directly without waiting for a Windows message:

```cpp
if(GetAsyncKeyState('W')) {
    // 'W' key is currently pressed
    m_Pos.y -= 0.001f; // Move upward
}
```

This approach allows for:
1. Continuous movement while a key is held down
2. Multiple key presses to be detected simultaneously
3. Input checking in sync with the game loop

## Working with the Windows GDI for Rendering

The Graphics Device Interface (GDI) is Windows' legacy system for drawing graphics. While modern games typically use more advanced APIs (DirectX, OpenGL, etc.), understanding GDI concepts is valuable for learning fundamental graphics principles.

### Device Context (DC)

A Device Context (DC) is a Windows structure that contains information about the drawing attributes of a device and serves as a container for drawing operations. It includes:

1. The destination (window) where drawing will occur
2. The current drawing tools (pen, brush, etc.)
3. Various drawing parameters and settings

### Customizing Drawing with Pens and Brushes

GDI uses two primary tools for drawing:
- **Pens**: Define how lines are drawn (color, width, style)
- **Brushes**: Define how enclosed areas are filled

Here's how to create and use custom pens and brushes:

```cpp
void Actor::Render(HDC _dc) {
    // Create a red pen
    HPEN hNewPen = CreatePen(PS_SOLID, 2, RGB(255, 0, 0));
    
    // Save the original pen and select our new one
    HPEN hPrevPen = (HPEN)SelectObject(_dc, hNewPen);
    
    // Create a green brush
    HBRUSH hNewBrush = CreateSolidBrush(RGB(20, 255, 20));
    
    // Save the original brush and select our new one
    HBRUSH hPrevBrush = (HBRUSH)SelectObject(_dc, hNewBrush);
    
    // Draw the rectangle (with red outline and green fill)
    Rectangle(_dc, 
            (int)(m_Pos.x - m_Scale.x / 2), 
            (int)(m_Pos.y - m_Scale.y / 2),
            (int)(m_Pos.x + m_Scale.x / 2), 
            (int)(m_Pos.y + m_Scale.y / 2));
    
    // Restore the original pen and brush
    SelectObject(_dc, hPrevPen);
    SelectObject(_dc, hPrevBrush);
    
    // Clean up our created objects
    DeleteObject(hNewPen);
    DeleteObject(hNewBrush);
}
```

### Understanding COLORREF and RGB Colors

Windows uses the COLORREF type to represent colors, which is essentially a 32-bit value where:
- The lowest 8 bits represent the red component (0-255)
- The next 8 bits represent the green component (0-255)
- The next 8 bits represent the blue component (0-255)
- The highest 8 bits are not used

The RGB macro simplifies creating these values:

```cpp
// Create a bright red color
COLORREF redColor = RGB(255, 0, 0);

// This is equivalent to:
COLORREF redColor = 255 | (0 << 8) | (0 << 16);
```

## Optimization for Drawing Tools

Creating and destroying GDI objects for every frame is inefficient. For better performance, you can create commonly used pens and brushes once and reuse them:

```cpp
class Engine {
private:
    // Arrays of common pens and brushes
    HPEN m_Pen[6];  // Different colored pens
    HBRUSH m_Brush[6];  // Different colored brushes
    
public:
    void Initialize() {
        // Create commonly used pens and brushes
        m_Pen[0] = CreatePen(PS_SOLID, 1, RGB(255, 0, 0));    // Red
        m_Pen[1] = CreatePen(PS_SOLID, 1, RGB(0, 255, 0));    // Green
        m_Pen[2] = CreatePen(PS_SOLID, 1, RGB(0, 0, 255));    // Blue
        // ... more pens and brushes
    }
    
    HPEN GetPen(int index) {
        return m_Pen[index];
    }
    
    void Release() {
        // Clean up all pens and brushes
        for(int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
            DeleteObject(m_Pen[i]);
            DeleteObject(m_Brush[i]);
        }
    }
};
```

## Understanding Frame Rate and Game Loop

Frame rate, measured in frames per second (FPS), determines how smoothly a game runs. The game loop controls this by executing Tick and Render operations repeatedly:

```cpp
// Simplified game loop
while(running) {
    // Process Windows messages
    // ...
    
    // Update all actors
    for(Actor* actor : actors) {
        actor->Tick();
    }
    
    // Render all actors
    for(Actor* actor : actors) {
        actor->Render(hDC);
    }
}
```

Modern games typically target specific frame rates (30, 60, 144 FPS, etc.) and may use frame timing to ensure consistent gameplay regardless of hardware speed.

## Interview Questions and Challenging Cases

1. **Q: Why would you use an actor-based architecture in game development?**  
   A: Actor-based architecture provides a consistent interface for all game objects, facilitates polymorphism for specialized behaviors, centralizes common functionality like positioning and rendering, and creates a clean separation of concerns through the Tick/Render pattern.

2. **Q: Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous input handling in games.**  
   A: Synchronous input handling waits for Windows messages like WM_KEYDOWN, which can cause input lag. Asynchronous input handling (using GetAsyncKeyState()) proactively checks the state of keys during the game loop, providing more responsive controls.

3. **Q: What are the trade-offs of using inline functions in a header file?**  
   A: Inline functions can improve performance by eliminating function call overhead, which is beneficial for small, frequently called functions. However, they can increase code size, slow compilation times, and make headers more difficult to maintain if overused.

4. **Q: How would you optimize the rendering of many similar objects?**  
   A: Some optimization strategies include: creating pens and brushes once at initialization rather than per frame, implementing object pooling, using culling techniques to avoid rendering off-screen objects, and batching similar draw calls.

5. **Q: Why use floating-point values for position instead of integers in a 2D game?**  
   A: Floating-point positions allow for sub-pixel movement, which enables smoother animation, particularly at varying frame rates. They also facilitate consistent movement speeds and can store accumulated small movements that would be lost with integer-only positions.

## Conclusion

Understanding actor-based architecture, game loops, rendering techniques, and efficient input handling provides a solid foundation for game development interviews. By mastering these concepts, you'll be better equipped to design and implement scalable, maintainable game systems.

Remember that while these examples use Windows GDI for simplicity, modern game development typically employs more advanced graphics APIs. However, the core principles of game architecture remain consistent across different rendering technologies.
