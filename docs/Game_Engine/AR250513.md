Sprite Asset 
Image piece basically 

One image containing several images as player image 
link_32.bmp file. 
about 32 images one character with different actions, and we want only one piece of those 32 to be used. 

Sprite asset certain texture inside certain value 

Sprite asset represents specific texture certain part only 
class ASprite: public Asset 
{
private: 
    ATexture* m_AtlasTex; 
    Veec2 m_LeftTop; 
    Vec2 m_Slice; // How to cut ? can be named as m_Area 

public: 
    void Create(ATexture* _AtlasTex, Vec2 _LeftTop, Vec2 _Slice); 
}


int ASprite::Load(const wstring& _FilePath)

void ASprite::Create(ATexture* _AtlasTex, Vec2 _LeftTop, Vec2 _Slice); 
We currently have no sprite usage file, so better to make sprite file 

map<wstring, ATexture*> m_mapTex; 
map<wstring, ASprite*> m_mapSprite; 

ASprite* FindSprite(const wstring & _Key);
ASprite* LoadSprite(const wstring & _Key, coinst wstring & _RelativePath);

Load Sprite 
ASprite* pSprite = FindSprite(_Key); 
FindSprite(_Key); 

void AssetMgr::AddSprite(const wstring& _Key, ASprite *_Sprite) 
{

}

Sprite File existance 
AssetMgr 
Initializer 
void Init(); 

PathMgr::Init(); 
AssetMgr()::Init(); 

First load texture to be used as sprite 
void AssetMgr::Init()
{
    // 
    LoadTexture (L"LinkTexture", L"Texture\\link_32.bmp"); 
}

ASprite *pSprite = new ASprite; 
pSprite->Create(); 
1200 X 1040 Pixels 

1200 / 10 = 120 width 
1040 / 8 = 130 length 
X Axis 

pSprite->Create(pAtlasTex, Vec2(240.f, 520.f), Vec2(120.f, 130.f))
AddSprite(L"Sprite_01", pSprite); 

class ASprite; 
Player now render itself as sprite, not image now 

LoadTexture(LinkTexture, Texture\\link_32.bmp) 

m_Image(nullptr), m_Sprite(nullptr) 
Texture Image 

Player Atlas Texture to top right 
Slice only some part of the entire bmp file should get parsed and rendered 
x y value Player location slice half half up 

m_Sprite->GetSlice().x / 2.f 
m_Sprite->GetSlice().y / 2.f 

Vec2 GetSlice(){return m_Slice;}
Vec2 GetLeftTop()

Player Render Function Sprite Pointing 
Several Sprites switch time continuously 
Atlas Texture to Sprite Animation 

All players and monsters will need sprite animations then how? 
Copy and paste all these functions will be too much 

Actor function added dilemma : class inheritance 
Actor class to player monster parsed and divided Actor is virtual class 

Monster Animation and Player Animation is required 
Use inheritance, Actor inherited Animactor 
Add animation, inherited player and monster will have animation function in default 
So virtual declaration of Animator function is required 
Actor inherited UI exist, Player monster health bar circumstance inventory status etc 
UI purpose animation 
Actor is drived from UI, but we want certain UI to have animation ... then how? 
The problem is game designers don't know programming so even though it is good idea 
programmers generally get exclusive for instance comics 
Game Designers can do programming and have understanding, so they design game by making sense 

Inheritance structure 
class inherit functions of parent
what if certain class want animation in inheritance tree ... how to predict this is Old fashioned  

Currently Component 
Pointer based Polymorphism is necessary, but since some need animation or others dont without clear inheritance structure 
Component based design like like equipment is required 
Diablo, Path of Exile : Tribe or Character Class 
If inheritance based structure ... Barbarian Archer Whatever ... 
if skills are independently implemented like a component, then skills might be shared. 

Actors main components inside inheritence 
Component class 
Component.h Component.cpp 

class Component 
{
private:


public: 
    virtual void FinalTick = 0; 

public: 
    Component(); 
    virtual ~Component(); // Inheritance parent, terminator must be virtual
}

Like Actor, Components will be used by Actor() 
Actor might have a lot of Componeents 

Component will have 
Collider 
Aminator // Sprite FlipbookPlayer etc several names per each different Engine 
RigidBody // 강체 
StateMachine // Game AI, not ML. All controlled by Programmer coded FSM

Collider might be several. for instance in FPS body head leg shot will be treated differently 

Components will also be based on polymorphism vector<Component*> m_vecCom; 
Actor will get Components as parent components 

Actor will also have FinalTick()' 
original Tick represented : what Actors execute per each frame 
FinalTick represents: what Components owned by Actor will do per each 
void Actor::FinalTick()
{
    for(size_t i=0; i<m_VecCom.size()l ++i)
    {
        m_vecCom[i]->FinalTick(); 
    }
}


enum COMPONENT_TYPE
{
    COLLIDER, 
    RIGIDBODY,
    FLIPBOOKPLAYER, 
    STATEMACHINE, 
}

class Component
{
private: 
    const COMPONENT_TYPE m_Type; 
public: 
    virtual void FinalTick() = 0; 
}

Rigid body perspective Component 
Rigid Body will contain enum value COMPONENT_TYPE 
If you make whatever COMPONENT type variable flip book player 

FB Player Type Rigid Body 

// Remove Default generator 
COMPONENT::COMPONENT(COMPONENT_TYPE _Type): m_Type(_Type)
{}

Now, default generator usage will cause error since parent class default generator is resetted 

FlipbookPlayer::FlipBookPlayer(): Component(COOMPONENT_TYPE::FLIPBOOKPLAYER)
{}

Actor does Not know aht component type it includes inside vector<Component*> in default 

So even though parent pointer points component 
parent class inherited 
runtime 
RTTI (RunTime Type Identification(or Identification)) During program execution what type notify. 
In this case RTTI is COMPONENT_TYPE 
also supported in language type called as dynamic_cast 

C++ RTTI dynamic_cast 

const COMPONENT_TYPE m_Type 
Collide Component  
State Machine Component 
Rigid Body Component 
Default Generator 

Collider::Collider():Component(COMPONENT_TYPE::COLLIDER)
virtual vodi FinalTick() override; 

all Component inherited classes to override 

Actor derived player monster etc all can receive 

void Actor::AddComponent(Component* _Component) // Could be whatever 
{
    m_vecCom
}

Actor instance and Actor Collider Component inputed inside Actor then it will point 
Player collider actor add component FP RB generate all and input Components 

pActor->AddComponent(new Collider); 
pActor->AddComponent(new FlipbookPlayer);

State Machine like Component Actor behavior Component 
Moster State Machine Player Actor find walk there move should know Actor current address 

class Actor* m_Owner 
Component generation process 
m_Owner(nullptr) 
Actor Component Vector pointing 
so now Actor know Components address and Components know owner Actor address now 

Each Component is newly dynamic allocation data inside heap so should be freed 

Level will also have FinalTick(); 
All Actors call FinalTick(); 
Then All Components inide each Actor will call FinalTick(); 

Flipbook player is kinda CD player 
Flipbook is kinda CD 
all group of sprite images 

class ASprite; 

class AFlipbook : public Asset{
    private: 
    vector<ASprite*> m_vecSprite; 
    public: 
    void AddSprite(int idx, ASprite *_Sprite); 
public: 
    AFlipBook(); 
    virtual ~AFlipBook(); 
}

AFlipBook

LinkSprite 
FindSprite 

// m_VecSprite.reserve(); // Empty Vector Space Get Only 
if(m_vecSprite.size()<= Idx){
    m_VecSprite.resize(idx+ 1);  // Empty Vector Space Get and Fill 
}

Now Animation will be done by FlipBookPlayer! 


# 0514 
Parent ptr to child class pointing is possible but child ptr pointing parent class does not work 
So forced casting is required 

Forced pointer casting from Component parent class to FlipbookPlayer child class 
FlipbookPlayer *pFlipbookPlayer = (*FlipbookPlayer)  GetComponent(COMPONENT_TYPE::FLIPBOOKPLAYER);

Down casting 

Component* pFlipBookPlayer = GetComponent(COMPONENT_TYPE::FLIPBOOKPLAYER); 

FlipbookPlayer *pFP = dynamic_cast<FlipbookPlayer*>(pFlipbookPlayer); 

this case preventing failure is possible 

Component inherited collider or FlipbookPlayer etc 
Forced casting will always make ptr as FlipBookPlayer, but suppose you made mistake so 
GetComponent returns another child class like Collider* which is another child class then it is dangerous 

Thus dynamic casting is much safer to ensure 
What you received is really ? 


Component* pFlipBookPlayer = GetComponent(COMPONENT_TYPE::FLIPBOOKPLAYER); 
FlipbookPlayer *pFP = dynamic_cast<FlipbookPlayer*>(pFlipbookPlayer);  
If this failed, aka returned pointer *Component pFlipbookPlayer is NOT FlipbookPlayer then 
dynamic_cast will return nullptr, instead of forcing non FlipbookPlayer class pointer forced    
Virtual function pointing result in 

one virtual function existence is required to make virtual function pointer __vptr ? 

Pointing by Component pointer or FlipbookPlayer pointer it would fine. 

But when you point newly generated pointer 
Down Casting by Dynamic Pointer. Whether it is possible to point it out or not 
If component Pointer is new flipbookPlayer pointer 

Suppose inheritance happened twice, so Component : FBPlayer : ChildFBPlayer 
Then, down casting from Component to FBPlayer Success, 
but you are NOT sure about whether it is FBPlayer or ChildFBPlayer 

That is why const COMPONENT_TYPE m_Type generation for each Component is recommended. 
dynamic_cast might be problematic for this reason when inheritance level is complicated 

FlipbookPlayer *pFP = dynamic_cast<FlipbookPlayer*>(GetComponent(L"FlipbookPlayer"));  
assert(pFlipbookPlayer); // assert of dynamic casting failed 

template<typename T>
T* GetComponent(const wstring& _Name);

RigidBody* GetComponent(const wstring& _Name);
Collider* GetComponent(const wstring& _Name);

Template is better this case. should be inside header file. If function gets big then do it outside class 
template<typename T>
T* Actor::GetComponent(const wstring& _Name){
    for(size_t i=-; i<m_VecCom.size(); ++i){

    }
}

Name Type T Type No input Compiler 
FlipbookPlayer* pFlipbookPlayer = GetComponent<FlipbookPlayer>(); // calls Like thi

Type T Component Type Ptr no need to do down casting now this way so that intended ptr is returned as intended class ptr
RTTI enum type downcasting 

Player Collider * m_Collider; 
FlipbookPlayer * m_FlipbookPlayer;

Player::Player(): 

template<typename T>
T AddComponent(T* _Component)
{

    m_vecCo.push_back(_Component); 
    _Component->m_Owner = this; 

    return _Component; 
}

Player should not delete Component 
also Actor will delete all Components 
so should NOT perform heap clening outside Actor parent class, double free 

FlipbookPlayter 
vector<AFlipbook*> m_PlayList; 
AFlipbook*         m_CurFlipBook; //

Now Player's FlibookPlayer will be in charge of rendering 
Among several sprite images owned by Fliboook Player 

int GetMaxSprite{ return m_vecSprite.size();}
ASprite* GetSprite(int idx){ return m_vecSprite[_Idx];}

if(m_CurFlipbook == nullptr) return;
