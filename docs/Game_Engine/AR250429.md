# Message Loops and Engine Architecture

## Introduction

Understanding Windows API programming fundamentals and engine architecture is essential for C++ game developers. While modern game development often relies on established game engines, mastering the underlying Windows message system and creating custom engine architectures provides a strong foundation for technical interviews and professional development. This guide explores Windows message processing and demonstrates how to build a basic game engine framework.

## Windows Message System

At the core of Windows applications lies the message system. This event-driven architecture enables user interaction by processing input and system events.

### GetMessage vs. PeekMessage

Traditional Windows applications use `GetMessage` to retrieve messages from the application's message queue:

```cpp
MSG msg;
while (GetMessage(&msg, nullptr, 0, 0)) {
    if (!TranslateAccelerator(msg.hwnd, hAccelTable, &msg)) {
        TranslateMessage(&msg);
        DispatchMessage(&msg);
    }
}
```

However, games require continuous execution even when no user input occurs. Here's how the two message-handling approaches differ:

| Function | Behavior | Return Value | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GetMessage` | Waits for messages, blocking execution | `false` for WM_QUIT, `true` otherwise | Regular applications |
| `PeekMessage` | Checks for messages without blocking | `true` if message exists, `false` otherwise | Games, real-time applications |

### The Game Message Loop Pattern

Games typically implement this message loop pattern:

```cpp
while (true) {
    if (PeekMessage(&msg, nullptr, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE)) {
        if (msg.message == WM_QUIT) {
            break; // Exit loop when WM_QUIT received
        } else {
            if (!TranslateAccelerator(msg.hwnd, hAccelTable, &msg))
            {
                TranslateMessage(&msg);
                DispatchMessage(&msg);
            }
        }
    } else {
        // No message in queue - run game logic here
        RunGame();
    }
}
```

This pattern ensures your game keeps running without interruption, while still processing Windows messages when they occur. In most frames, the `else` block runs (~99.99% of the time), allowing continuous gameplay.

### Message Processing Flow

When a message is retrieved:

1. `TranslateMessage` converts virtual-key messages to character messages
2. `DispatchMessage` sends the message to the window procedure function

### Window Procedure Function

Each window has a procedure function that handles its messages:

```cpp
LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hWnd, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
    switch (message) {
    case WM_COMMAND:
        // Handle menu commands
        switch (LOWORD(wParam)) {
        case IDM_ABOUT:
            DialogBox(hInst, MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDD_ABOUTBOX), hWnd, About);
            break;
        case IDM_EXIT:
            DestroyWindow(hWnd);
            break;
        default:
            return DefWindowProc(hWnd, message, wParam, lParam);
        }
        break;

    case WM_DESTROY:
        PostQuitMessage(0); // This sends WM_QUIT to the message queue
        break;

    default:
        return DefWindowProc(hWnd, message, wParam, lParam);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Key points:
- `message` parameter contains the message type (like WM_COMMAND = 273)
- `wParam` often contains additional information (like which menu item was clicked)
- `DefWindowProc` handles standard window behavior when you don't need custom handling
- `PostQuitMessage(0)` puts a WM_QUIT message in the queue, which will cause the message loop to exit

## Building a Game Engine Framework

Now let's examine how to build a simple game engine architecture that works with the Windows message system.

### The Singleton Pattern

Most engine subsystems use the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance exists:

```cpp
class Engine {
private:
    // Private constructor and destructor
    Engine();
    ~Engine();

    // Delete copy constructor and assignment operator
    Engine(const Engine& _Other) = delete;
    Engine& operator=(const Engine& _Other) = delete;

public:
    // Static instance getter
    static Engine* GetInst() {
        static Engine mgr;
        return &mgr;
    }
    
    // Engine methods...
};
```

This pattern has several key characteristics:
- Private constructor prevents external instantiation
- Static method returns the single instance
- Copy constructor and assignment operator are deleted to prevent duplication

For convenience, you can create a macro to generate singleton code:

```cpp
#define SINGLE(ClassName) \
public: \
    static ClassName* GetInst() { \
        static ClassName mgr; \
        return &mgr; \
    } \
private: \
    ClassName(); \
    ~ClassName(); \
    ClassName(const ClassName& _Other) = delete; \
    ClassName& operator=(const ClassName& _Other) = delete;
```

Then use it like this:

```cpp
class Engine {
    SINGLE(Engine)
    
    // Engine methods...
};
```

### Engine Class Implementation

The Engine class manages core functionality including window handling and rendering:

```cpp
class Engine {
    SINGLE(Engine)

private:
    HINSTANCE m_hInst;       // Process handle
    HWND m_hMainWnd;         // Main window handle
    POINT m_Resolution;      // Window resolution
    HDC m_MainDC;            // Device context for rendering

public:
    void Init(HINSTANCE _Inst, HWND _hWnd, UINT _Width, UINT _Height);
    void Progress();         // Main game loop function
};
```

The initialization method sets up the engine:

```cpp
void Engine::Init(HINSTANCE _Inst, HWND _hWnd, UINT _Width, UINT _Height)
{
    m_hInst = _Inst;
    m_hMainWnd = _hWnd;
    m_Resolution = POINT{(LONG)_Width, (LONG)_Height};
    
    // Position and size the window
    SetWindowPos(m_hMainWnd, nullptr, 10, 10, m_Resolution.x, m_Resolution.y, 0);
    
    // Get device context for rendering
    m_MainDC = GetDC(m_hMainWnd);
}
```

The constructor initializes members to safe defaults:

```cpp
Engine::Engine() :
    m_hInst(nullptr),
    m_hMainWnd(nullptr),
    m_Resolution{},
    m_MainDC(nullptr)
{
}
```

The destructor releases resources:

```cpp
Engine::~Engine()
{
    if (m_MainDC != nullptr) {
        ReleaseDC(m_hMainWnd, m_MainDC);
    }
}
```

The Progress method contains game logic and rendering:

```cpp
void Engine::Progress()
{
    // Example: Draw a rectangle
    Rectangle(m_MainDC, 200, 200, 300, 300);
    
    // Game update and rendering code would go here
}
```

### Integrating with the Windows Message Loop

Here's how to integrate the Engine with the Windows message loop:

```cpp
int APIENTRY wWinMain(_In_ HINSTANCE hInstance,
                      _In_opt_ HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,
                      _In_ LPWSTR    lpCmdLine,
                      _In_ int       nCmdShow)
{
    // Register window class and create window...
    HWND hWnd = CreateWindow(...);

    // Initialize the engine
    Engine::GetInst()->Init(hInstance, hWnd, 1280, 768);

    MSG msg;
    while (true) {
        if (PeekMessage(&msg, nullptr, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE)) {
            if (msg.message == WM_QUIT) {
                break;
            }
            
            TranslateMessage(&msg);
            DispatchMessage(&msg);
        } else {
            // Run game logic when no messages are waiting
            Engine::GetInst()->Progress();
        }
    }

    return (int)msg.wParam;
}
```

## Using Precompiled Headers

To improve compilation speed, use precompiled headers for commonly included files:

1. Create a `pch.h` file with common includes:
```cpp
#pragma once

#include <windows.h>
// Other common includes
#include "define.h"  // For our singleton macro
```

2. Create a corresponding `pch.cpp` that includes it:
```cpp
#include "pch.h"
```

3. Configure Visual Studio to use precompiled headers:
   - Right-click on the project → Properties
   - C/C++ → Precompiled Headers
   - Set "Precompiled Header" to "Use (/Yu)"
   - Set "Precompiled Header File" to "pch.h"
   - For `pch.cpp` specifically, set to "Create (/Yc)"

4. Include `pch.h` at the top of all .cpp files:
```cpp
#include "pch.h"
// Other includes...
```

## Drawing with Device Context

The Windows API provides functions to draw on a window using a Device Context (DC):

```cpp
void Engine::Progress()
{
    // Clear background (optional)
    RECT clientRect;
    GetClientRect(m_hMainWnd, &clientRect);
    FillRect(m_MainDC, &clientRect, (HBRUSH)GetStockObject(WHITE_BRUSH));
    
    // Draw a rectangle
    Rectangle(m_MainDC, 200, 200, 300, 300);
    
    // Draw text
    SetTextColor(m_MainDC, RGB(0, 0, 0));
    SetBkMode(m_MainDC, TRANSPARENT);
    TextOut(m_MainDC, 100, 100, L"Hello, Game!", 12);
}
```

6. **Practical Question**: Write a Windows message loop suitable for a game that needs to run at 60 FPS.

7. **DeviceContext Question**: What is a Device Context in Windows and how is it used for drawing?

8. **Advanced Question**: How would you implement frame rate control in a Windows-based game using the architecture described?

## Conclusion

Understanding Windows message processing and engine architecture provides a strong foundation for C++ game development. While modern games often use established engines, knowing how these systems work under the hood is valuable for optimization, debugging, and technical interviews.

The techniques covered here—message loops, the Singleton pattern, window management, and basic rendering—form building blocks that you can expand into more complex game engines. With this knowledge, you can build your own custom game frameworks or better understand existing engines.

Remember that production-ready game engines have many additional components like resource management, input systems, scene graphs, physics, audio, and more sophisticated rendering. However, the architectural patterns described here scale to those more complex systems.
