Image data input 

Game launch file process

Suppose player location painting should be painted 
its image pixel 123 124 
15252 

most pixels are colored in magenta for should be vacant space 
and other graphics are non magenta 
now place this flight image 

bitmap to bitmap copy bitblt receives DCs 
Suppose bitmap DC is connected to bitmap drawn with jet flight

back buffer DC currently managed in DC 

Now we paint flight painted bitmap and DC , and based on player location 
draw 123 124 

fill the pixel 
0, 0 pixel image color to the pixel on 123 124 to copy and paste ? 

CreateCompatibleBitmap 
this one creates just empty big bitmap 
but instead we are going to use assets 

When process executes it works on RAM 
so from our image make bitmap from image and copy it ? 
Texture folder fighter.bmp relative path 
From C:\ to contents folder it will be absolute path but 
from contents folder assets like Sound Texture ... 
Relative Path Fighter.bmp memory load and 
generate bitmap and fill bitmap pixels based on image file loaded from SSD 
bitmap is in RAM, texture file bmp png jpg whatever exist in SSD 
so exe file running in RAM generates bitmap and load it from SSD 

One Monster several bitmaps ? 1 Image loading 
If mosters are all same ... then ? 
Only one original bitmap, but for each wishing actor it can be shared ? 
Assets 

Asset class 
one objet sharable ? 

Image file load from back buffer copy pixel and objects share same images 

Bitmap pixel borrowing 

If player want use that texture copy it 
copy needs DC 

Texture class instance requires bitmap and dc! 

player by loading image function overriding 



PathMgr Player use image 

Windows OS 

Bitmap and DC are used 

DC connected 
bitmap pixels 

Bitmap on back buffer to the bitmap displalyed in the main window 
always dc connected to bitmap copy 

Bitblt 
origin image color originally magenta color 

Should be hallow image is set up as magenta 255 0 255 right now 
123 X 124 pixel back buffer to main DC 
Copied well. 

Magenta color why? It should not be displayed but become hallow

Your goal is to make star or rectangle or umbrella 

Pixel also 123 124 shape you draw 
but it is impossible to have it as hallow space ? 
so it gets from 0 0 pixel to 123 124 pixels and fill it 
while to notice unnecessary space fill it with magenta 
If you fill it with black 0 0 0 color, but black is often used so not recommended 
same for white 255255255 those pixels are also often used, while magenta is not 

Chromaki generally use green background color in movie 
inserting that image 
classical computer graphics 
but superman inside green area might turun that green part into background too lol CG error 

Bitmap image function 
bitblt similar but 
TransparentBlt(); 
Instead of just normal bitblt it has transparecy color function for the last parameter 
exact copy and paste for parameters used in BitBlt, except one more additional input that will neutralize its color 
RGB macro magenta color will be empty RGB(255,0,255); 

So copy it into a destination 
Error LNK1120 Link error 
when function declaration only and not exist 
Function is declared and used but not actually written 

Windows program include Windows header in pch 

#include <Windows.h>

Function used very well 
CreateWindow SetPos etc ... when we just included headers. 
The reason why this exist 
Visual Studio automatically setup project link and connection 
Those are called as library 

Tick Render etc ... 

Method 1 
Give Header file and CPP file both 

Compile process 
linking moment 
just give entire code 
problem : it entirely exposes your code... 
but what if you want to hide this cpp source code, while allowing it to use? 

Make header file and cpp file to compiled binary code so that it can be used while cpp code is invisible 

Windows dont even let us see its OS code kernel objects, so we should access only by Windows kernel object ID not code 
We just link it. We include Windows header and use those functions during compile 

But, why TransparentBlt is not used ? 
Generally this is not really used well normally. 
BitBlt is included in Windows.h but TransparentBlt is kinda used rarely 

Windows header include 
a lot of header files 
Library is linked automatically by including Windows.h 
It has header file ... but linking of cpp file is not yet ? 

Header file exist inside Windows.h so compile process it is possible , but 
cpp file does not get linked inside Windows.h so we should access 

Search TransparentBlt Function inside Microsoft 

Header in wingdi.h, which is included in Windows.h 
So we brought header info, 
but its actual library is inside Msimg32.lib 
https://learn.microsoft.com/ko-kr/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-transparentblt

#include <Windows.h>
#pragma comment(lib, "Msimg32.lib") 

Borrow to link together 

Now no link error anymore! 

All prepared bmp files are filled with Magenta right now 


Let Texture class generator and terminator private 
friend class AssetMgr though 

Assets might be a lot hundreds 
AssetMgr 
Search Quick data structure 

Key Value 
map<int, int>
BST 
If Key is string 
String Commparison to sort in order ..? is possible but 
it is in alphabetical order 
Programming Implementation? Ascii Code value Char is actually number 

ABC ABCD 
Smaller String length is in priority 

String sort means which one is bigger or smaller 

Confusion: When learning string we learn as "whatever" 
but inside code this is actually saved inside ROM as phrase and 
optimized so when it is called access its address inside ROM and use that address 
So program execution process it is saved inside ROM and must borrow its address by const pointer 

 static cast access to the string represents forced change to the ROM area so it might cause error 

 map<const wchar_t*, value >
 This approach might cause problem it might not be intuitive enough 
 suppose key value is 

 public: 
 map<const wchar_t*, int> mapStrings; 
 mapString.insert(make_pair(L"Hello", 10)); 
 mapString.insert(make_pair(L"MyName", 20)); 

 It works fine without any compile error 
mapString.find(L"Hello"); 
map<const wchar_t*, int>:: iterator iter = mapString.find(L"Hello"); 
if(iter != mapString.end())
{
    int a = iter->second; // a became 10, so it kinda works well! 
}

But critical problem exist 
map first type is POINTER type. 8 bytes address somewhere 
map can get input as Addreess of string, not string itself! 
ROM area address is string 

map saved Address value of string as Key, not string itself!!! 
So Address value comparison was used inside map, NOT Strings themselves! 

So if you use 
 mapString.insert(make_pair(L"Hello", 10)); 
This again, then it gets very problematic. 

It is not inserting string "Hello" inside map again, but its ROM address already generated and saved inside ROM 
wchar_t szString[100] = L"Hello"; 
it borrows string value from "Hello" existing inside ROM copied by address access 
so L"Hello" address and szString address will be completely different 
szString inside stack while L"Hello" string saved inside ROM and used as pointer to access ROM area 
iter = mapString.find(szString); 
This will NOT return L"Hello" input above that will save ROM address of L"Hello" 
thus map find by szString will search by address of newly generated 
String value designation 

specific string containor wstring or string class 
Lets use map key val as wstring, not pointer but class wstring 
wstring is string managing STL class 

it is very similar to vector, dynamic array 
internally it supports several operator functiosn 
wstring str1 = L"Hello"; 
wstring str2 = L"Hello"; 
In this case, str1 and str2 will manage their data inside heap memory dynamically allocated, 
filling their H e l l o characters inside assigned space

Since they manage str, when their operator == happens 
they check by their data NOT pointer 
So even though str1 and str2 have different address 
if their contents inside heap are same its operator check by each character 

Also similarly works for big small operators < > so comparison works as intended 
operator<(str1, str2) // same as str1 < str2 
They compare each element from index 0 to end by accessing each character stored in their assigned heap 
wstring 
map<wstring, whatever_value>
Thus, this will work as intended in alphabetical order 
instead of really using input string that will execute == or > < operators by using ROM pointers 

map<wstring, whatever_value>
and for this usage 
myMap.find(L"Hello"); // This will work without problem 

find function will be find(wstring _str); for this map 
so even though you input by L"whatever" direct string input find function will suppose input string as wstring data type 

Also wstring map will use copy operator of static array like wchar_t szString[100] = L"whatever" this will work too for map<wstring, whatever_value>

string or array 

so for our asset manager 

map<wstring, ATexture*> m_mapTex; 
This will be used. Search by string will work by this way for these reasons 

FindTexture 
LoadTexture 
by wstring is now possible! it is more easy now to find and load texture 

texture class 

m_Image = AssetMgr::Get()->LoadTexture(L"Fighter", L"Texture\\Fighter.bmp"); 

#include "PathMgr.h" 

wstring ContentPath = PathMgr::GetInst()->GetContentPath(); 
m_Image = new ATexture; 

pNewTex->Load(ContentPath  + _RelativePath); 

m_mapTex.insert(make_pair(_Key, pNewTex)); 

m_Texture = AssetMgr::GetInst()->LoadTexture(L"Sonic", L"Texture\\Idle_left.bmp");
