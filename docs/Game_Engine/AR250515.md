Key manager singleton 
tick 
Engine 
KeyMgr // Kinda InputMgr ? 
TimeMgr::GetInst()->Tick(); 
KeyMgr::GetInst()->Tick(); 
LevelMgr::GetInst()->Tick(); 

Now check all key status 
void KeyMgR::Tick()
{
    for(size_t i=0; i< m_vecKeys.size(); ++i)
    {
        if(GetAsyncKeyState('W')){}
    }
}

What windows get about key val and you get is completely different so 
int KeyData[KEY_END] = 
{

}
Windows key press preprocessor VK_RETURN // Keyboard key Enter 
if(GetAsyncKeyState(VK_RETURN)) is Enter press 
'0'
'1'
... 
'W'
'A'
///
VK_MENU 
VK_CONTROL
VK_SPACE
VK_LSCHIP
VK_ESCAPE
VK_END 

if(GetAsyncKeyState(KeyData[i])) {
    m_VecKeys[i].PrevPressed = true; 
}else {
    m_VecKeys[i].PrevPressed = false; 
}

KeyData[i].State; 

enum KEY_STATE{
    NONE, 
    TAP, // Pressed at Now Tick  
    PRESSED, // Pressed at previous tick and currently still pressed 
    RELEASED // Pressed at previous tick and not pressed this tick 
}

So TAP and RELEASED should be one Tick and after that should be NONE or PRESSED 

Game 1 second to 60 frames processed 철권 PVP game 1 sec to 60 Frame because 
격투 게임은 예상을 하면 안됨 
1 Frame to 랙 > 
1000 0.5 1/2 500 so delta time system lack Delta Time it would make serious problem 
Collision 판정 정교 include collision and damage input when knife moves it takes a second but 랙 DT gets over a seocnd 
weapon should hit monster ... but if DT makes monster lack caused so collision does not happen due to lack 
DT based game, no execptional cases then you use weapon, but frame let knife top to down directly so collison might not happen 

Also if character moves to the wall collision should happen, but if frame drop became 500FPS to 1FPS then it can literally ignore wall and go straight
DT based system current position and DT increments a lot so if collision exist it should get checked ... so 
Game 1 second divided by 60 frames still so FRAME fixed to execute tick and collision happening check 

3 / 60 If RA key pressed 1/60 second is still very short time and even though you press it again 5 Frame 
and animation speed too so if it takes about 15 frames, then attack wil happen about 20 frames 

20 frame delay enemy unable to gurard, 

So anyway key frame should be figured out 
GetAsyncState if key is pressed 
PrevPressed records whether it is previously pressed in the previous frame 

if(GetAsyncKeyState(KeyData[i]))
{
    if(m_vecKeys[i].PrevPressed){ // pressed in previous frame and still pressed 
        m_vecKeys[i].State = PRESSED;
    }

    else { // Not pressed in previous frame 
        m_vecKeys[i].State = TAP;
    }
}

else {
    if(m_vecKeys[i].PrevPressed){ // not pressed in previous frame and still not pressed 
        m_vecKeys[i].State = RELEASED;
    }

    else { // pressed in previous frame and not pressed this frame 
        m_vecKeys[i].State = NONE;
    }
}

Now key check complete 
and windows will get KeyMgr received info 
instead of GetAsyncKeyState('W) 
KeyMgr::GetInst()->GetKeyState(Key::W) == PRESSED
