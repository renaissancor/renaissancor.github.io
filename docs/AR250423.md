# Inheritance, Polymorphism, Virtual Functions, Overriding

*Last updated: April 23, 2025*

This comprehensive guide explores advanced inheritance concepts in C++, focusing on polymorphism, virtual functions, and function overriding. These concepts are crucial for game programmers to master, as they form the foundation of object-oriented game architecture.

## Function Overriding vs. Overloading

These are two different concepts that are often confused but serve distinct purposes in C++.

### Function Overriding

Function overriding occurs when a derived class redefines a function that already exists in its base class, using the same function signature (name and parameters). The purpose is to provide a specialized implementation for an inherited method.

Key characteristics of function overriding:
- Requires inheritance relationship between classes
- Same function name and parameter list
- Occurs between base and derived classes
- Base class function can still be accessed explicitly

Example of function overriding:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    void Output() {
        cout << "Base Class" << endl;
    }
};

class Child : public Base {
public:
    void Output() {  // Overrides Base::Output()
        cout << "Child Class" << endl;
    }
};
```

When we create a `Child` object and call `Output()`, the child's version is called by default. However, we can still access the parent's version when needed:

```cpp
Child child;
child.Output();       // Calls Child::Output()
child.Base::Output(); // Explicitly calls Base::Output()
```

### Function Overloading

Function overloading occurs when multiple functions in the same scope have the same name but different parameter lists. The compiler determines which function to call based on the arguments provided.

Example of function overloading:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    void Func();                // Version with no parameters
    void Func(int input);       // Version with one int parameter
    void Func(int input1, int input2); // Version with two int parameters
};
```

The key difference: overriding is about providing different implementations of the same function in an inheritance hierarchy, while overloading is about providing multiple functions with the same name but different parameters in the same scope.

## Polymorphism in C++

Polymorphism is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming. In C++, it allows us to treat objects of derived classes as objects of their base class, while still maintaining their unique behaviors.

### Pointer-Based Polymorphism

A key feature of C++ is that a pointer to a base class can point to any object of a derived class:

```cpp
class Parent {
private:
    float m_P;
};

class Child : public Parent {
private:
    short m_S;
};

int main() {
    Parent P;
    Child C;
    
    Parent* pParent = &P;  // Parent pointer to Parent object - always works
    Child* pChild = &C;    // Child pointer to Child object - always works
    
    pParent = &C;  // Parent pointer to Child object - works due to polymorphism
    // pChild = &P;  // Child pointer to Parent object - DOES NOT WORK
    
    return 0;
}
```

This demonstrates that a base class pointer can point to a derived class object, but not vice versa. This is because a derived class object contains all the members of its base class (and potentially more), so a base class pointer can safely access the base class portion of a derived class object.

### Memory Layout

Understanding memory layout helps explain why polymorphism works this way:

```
Parent object: [m_P (4 bytes)]
Child object:  [m_P (4 bytes)][m_S (2 bytes, padded to 4)]
```

When `pParent = &C`, the pointer points to the start of the `Child` object, which contains the `Parent` portion. The pointer only "sees" the `Parent` portion of the object, ignoring any additional members that the `Child` may have.

### Benefits of Polymorphism in Game Programming

In game development, polymorphism allows for elegant design patterns. Consider a game engine with various actor types:

```cpp
class Actor {
public:
    virtual void Tick() { /* Base implementation */ }
};

class Player : public Actor {
public:
    virtual void Tick() override { /* Player-specific logic */ }
};

class Monster : public Actor {
public:
    virtual void Tick() override { /* Monster-specific logic */ }
};

// In game level:
std::vector<Actor*> gameActors;  // Container for all actors
```

With polymorphism, we can store pointers to different derived classes (`Player`, `Monster`, etc.) in a single container of base class pointers (`Actor*`). This simplifies game architecture significantly compared to maintaining separate containers for each type:

```cpp
// Without polymorphism, we would need:
std::vector<Player*> players;
std::vector<Monster*> monsters;
// And so on for each type...
```

## Virtual Functions

While polymorphism allows us to use a base class pointer to point to derived class objects, there's a problem: by default, calling a method through a base class pointer will invoke the base class version of that method, even if the derived class has overridden it.

### The Polymorphism Problem

```cpp
class Parent {
public:
    void Move() {
        cout << "!!Parent Move!!" << endl;
    }
};

class Child : public Parent {
public:
    void Move() {
        cout << "!!Child Move!!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Parent P;
    Child C;
    
    Parent* pParent = &P;
    pParent->Move();  // Calls Parent::Move() - expected
    
    pParent = &C;
    pParent->Move();  // Still calls Parent::Move() - NOT what we want!
    
    return 0;
}
```

This behavior occurs because the compiler performs static binding at compile time based on the pointer type, not the object type. For game engines that rely on polymorphism, this is problematic.

### Virtual Functions to the Rescue

The `virtual` keyword changes this behavior by enabling dynamic binding, where the function call is resolved at runtime based on the actual object type:

```cpp
class Parent {
public:
    virtual void Move() {
        cout << "!!Parent Move!!" << endl;
    }
};

class Child : public Parent {
public:
    void Move() override {  // 'override' keyword is optional but recommended
        cout << "!!Child Move!!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Parent P;
    Child C;
    
    Parent* pParent = &P;
    pParent->Move();  // Calls Parent::Move()
    
    pParent = &C;
    pParent->Move();  // Now calls Child::Move() - correct polymorphic behavior!
    
    return 0;
}
```

The `virtual` keyword tells the compiler to look up the function implementation at runtime rather than compile time, ensuring that the overridden version in the derived class is called.

## Memory Layout and Virtual Function Tables

Understanding how virtual functions work requires delving into the C++ object memory layout.

### Virtual Function Tables (VTables)

When a class contains at least one virtual function, the compiler creates a special data structure called a virtual function table (VTable) for that class:

1. Each class with virtual functions gets its own VTable
2. The VTable contains function pointers to the actual implementations
3. Each object of the class stores a hidden pointer (often called `__vfptr`) to its class's VTable

This explains why classes with virtual functions often have a larger memory footprint:

```cpp
class NoVirtual {
    float m_Value;  // 4 bytes
};  // sizeof(NoVirtual) = 4 bytes

class WithVirtual {
    float m_Value;  // 4 bytes
    // Plus hidden vptr (8 bytes on x64)
    virtual void SomeFunc() {}
};  // sizeof(WithVirtual) = 16 bytes (with padding)
```

### How Virtual Function Dispatch Works

When calling a virtual function through a pointer or reference:

1. The compiler generates code to access the object's `__vfptr`
2. The code looks up the appropriate function in the VTable (each virtual function has an index)
3. The function at that index is called

This runtime lookup allows the correct overridden method to be called regardless of the pointer type.

### VTable Inheritance

In an inheritance hierarchy:

1. A derived class inherits the VTable structure from its base class
2. When a derived class overrides a virtual function, its VTable entry is updated to point to the derived implementation
3. When a derived class doesn't override a virtual function, its VTable entry points to the base class implementation

This mechanism enables the correct function to be called based on the actual object type at runtime.

## Copy Constructor in Inheritance

When working with inheritance, proper implementation of copy constructors is critical to ensure that the entire object, including the base class portion, is correctly copied.

### The Default Copy Constructor Problem

By default, if you don't define a copy constructor in a derived class, the compiler generates one that:

1. Calls the base class's default constructor (not its copy constructor)
2. Makes member-by-member copies of the derived class's own members

This can lead to incomplete copying of objects:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    int m_a;
    float m_f;
    
    Base() : m_a(0), m_f(0.f) {}
    
    Base(const Base& other) 
        : m_a(other.m_a), m_f(other.m_f) {}
};

class Child : public Base {
public:
    long long m_Child;
    
    Child() : m_Child(0) {}
    
    // Incorrect (automatic) copy constructor:
    // Child(const Child& other) : Base(), m_Child(other.m_Child) {}
};
```

In this example, the automatic copy constructor would initialize the `Base` portion using the default constructor, losing the values from the original `Base` portion.

### Correctly Implementing Copy Constructors

To properly implement a copy constructor in a derived class, explicitly call the base class's copy constructor:

```cpp
class Child : public Base {
public:
    long long m_Child;
    
    Child() : m_Child(0) {}
    
    // Correct copy constructor:
    Child(const Child& other)
        : Base(other),  // Call base copy constructor with the other object
          m_Child(other.m_Child) {}
};
```

This ensures that both the base and derived portions of the object are properly copied.

## Practical Examples

Let's examine a complete implementation demonstrating polymorphism and virtual functions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Parent {
private:
    float m_P;

public:
    virtual void Move() {
        cout << "!!Parent Move!!" << endl;
    }

    virtual void Test() {
        // Base implementation
    }
};

class Child : public Parent {
private:
    short m_S;

public:
    void Move() override {
        cout << "!!Child Move!!" << endl;
    }

    void Test() override {
        // Child implementation
    }
};

int main() {
    Parent P;
    Child C;

    // Size affected by virtual function table pointer
    int size = sizeof(P);  // Larger than just float due to __vfptr
    size = sizeof(C);      // Even larger - includes parent + own members + __vfptr

    Parent* pParent = &P;
    Child* pChild = &C;

    // Polymorphism allows this
    pParent = &C;  // Parent pointer to Child object
    
    // Virtual function ensures proper dispatch
    pParent->Move();  // Calls Child::Move() due to virtual function
    pParent->Test();  // Calls Child::Test() due to virtual function

    return 0;
}
```

And here's an example of proper copy constructor implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    int m_a;
    float m_f;

public:
    Base() : m_a(0), m_f(0.f) {}

    Base(const Base& other)
        : m_a(other.m_a), m_f(other.m_f) {}
};

class Child : public Base {
public:
    long long m_Child;

public:
    Child() : m_Child(0) {}

    // Proper copy constructor implementation
    Child(const Child& other)
        : Base(other),  // Call base copy constructor
          m_Child(other.m_Child) {}
};

int main() {
    Base b1;
    b1.m_a = 10;
    b1.m_f = 3.33f;

    Base b2 = b1;  // Uses Base copy constructor

    Child c1;
    c1.m_a = 1;
    c1.m_f = 2.f;
    c1.m_Child = 3;

    Child c2(c1);  // Uses our properly implemented Child copy constructor
                   // Both Base and Child portions are copied correctly

    return 0;
}
```

## Interview Questions

Here are some common interview questions related to inheritance, polymorphism, and virtual functions:

**Q: What is the difference between function overloading and function overriding?**  
A: Overloading is defining multiple functions with the same name but different parameters in the same scope. Overriding is redefining a virtual function in a derived class with the same signature as in the base class to provide specialized behavior.

**Q: Why can a base class pointer point to a derived class object but not vice versa?**  
A: A base class pointer can point to a derived class object because the derived class contains all the members of the base class. The reverse isn't possible because a derived class might have additional members that a base class object doesn't contain.

**Q: How do virtual functions work under the hood?**  
A: Virtual functions work through virtual function tables (VTables). Each class with virtual functions has a VTable containing function pointers. Objects of such classes contain a hidden pointer to their class's VTable. When a virtual function is called, the appropriate function is looked up in the VTable at runtime, enabling dynamic binding.

**Q: What's the difference between calling a virtual function and a non-virtual function through a base class pointer?**  
A: When calling a non-virtual function through a base class pointer, the function called is determined by the pointer type at compile time (static binding). For virtual functions, the function called is determined by the actual object type at runtime (dynamic binding).

**Q: Why should base class destructors be virtual in polymorphic code?**  
A: If a derived class object is deleted through a base class pointer and the destructor isn't virtual, only the base class destructor will be called, potentially leading to resource leaks. Making the destructor virtual ensures that the proper destructor chain is called.

**Q: What happens in the default copy constructor of a derived class?**  
A: The default copy constructor of a derived class calls the default constructor (not the copy constructor) of the base class and then copies the derived class's members. This often leads to incomplete copying of the object.

**Q: How do you correctly implement a copy constructor in a derived class?**  
A: By explicitly calling the base class's copy constructor in the initialization list and then handling the derived class's members: `Derived(const Derived& other) : Base(other), /* derived members */ {}`.

Understanding these advanced C++ inheritance concepts is essential for game programmers who need to create flexible, maintainable game architectures. Virtual functions and polymorphism are particularly important in game engines, where they enable systems that can process many different types of game objects without needing to know their specific types.
