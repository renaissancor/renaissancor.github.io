## Tree Terminology and Structure

### Basic Tree Concepts

Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. Unlike graphs, trees cannot contain cycles.

Key terminology:
- **Root Node**: The topmost node in a tree hierarchy (has no parent)
- **Leaf Node**: Any node without children
- **Internal Node**: A node with at least one child
- **Edge**: Connection between two nodes
- **Depth**: Length of the path from the root to a node
- **Height**: Length of the longest path from a node to a leaf

### Binary Trees

A binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and right child.

```
   A
  / \
 B   C
/ \ / \
D E F  G
```

### Complete Binary Tree (CBT)

A complete binary tree fills levels from left to right before moving to the next level:
- Nodes are added from left to right at each level
- All levels except possibly the last are completely filled
- The last level has all nodes as far left as possible

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```

### Perfect Binary Tree

A perfect binary tree is a complete binary tree where all levels are fully filled:
- All internal nodes have exactly two children
- All leaf nodes are at the same level

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \ / \
4  5 6  7
```

Note: A perfect binary tree is a state or condition of a complete binary tree, not a separate structure.

## Binary Search Trees (BST)

A binary search tree is a binary tree with an ordering property:
- For each node, all values in its left subtree are less than the node's value
- For each node, all values in its right subtree are greater than the node's value

```
    8
   / \
  3   10
 / \    \
1   6    14
   / \   /
  4   7 13
```

### BST Operations Performance

| Operation | Average Case | Worst Case |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Insert    | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
| Delete    | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
| Search    | O(log n)     | O(n)       |

### Comparison with Other Data Structures

| Structure          | Insert     | Indexing   | Delete     | Search     |
|--------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Dynamic Array**  | O(1)       | O(1)       | O(n)       | O(n)       |
| **Linked List**    | O(1)       | O(n)       | O(1)       | O(n)       |
| **BST**            | O(log n)   | O(n)       | O(log n)   | O(log n)   |

Note: The worst-case time complexity for BST operations becomes O(n) when the tree is unbalanced (e.g., when inserting sorted data).

## Tree Traversal Methods

Tree traversal refers to the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure exactly once. The four main traversal methods are:

### 1. Pre-Order Traversal (Node-Left-Right)

Algorithm:
1. Visit the current node
2. Recursively traverse the left subtree
3. Recursively traverse the right subtree

Use cases:
- Creating a copy of the tree
- Getting prefix expression of an expression tree

### 2. In-Order Traversal (Left-Node-Right)

Algorithm:
1. Recursively traverse the left subtree
2. Visit the current node
3. Recursively traverse the right subtree

Use cases:
- BST traversal in sorted order
- Infix expression evaluation

### 3. Post-Order Traversal (Left-Right-Node)

Algorithm:
1. Recursively traverse the left subtree
2. Recursively traverse the right subtree
3. Visit the current node

Use cases:
- Deleting or freeing nodes in a tree
- Getting postfix expression of an expression tree

### 4. Level-Order Traversal (Breadth-First)

Algorithm:
1. Start at the root
2. Visit all nodes at the current level
3. Move to the next level

Implementation typically uses a queue data structure.

### Example Traversals

```
Given the tree:
    A
   / \
  B   C
 / \ / 
D  E F

Pre-Order:   A → B → D → E → C → F
In-Order:    D → B → E → A → F → C
Post-Order:  D → E → B → F → C → A
Level-Order: A → B → C → D → E → F
```

## Heap Data Structures

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property:

- **Min-Heap**: For any node, the parent's value is less than or equal to its children's values
- **Max-Heap**: For any node, the parent's value is greater than or equal to its children's values

Heaps are implemented as complete binary trees, which allows them to be efficiently represented using arrays:

- For a node at index `k`:
  - Left child: `2k + 1`
  - Right child: `2k + 2`
  - Parent: `(k - 1) / 2`

Array representation of a max-heap:
```
[10, 7, 9, 3, 2, 8, 1]

Visualized as:
     10
    /  \
   7    9
  / \  / \
 3  2 8  1
```

### Heap Operations

| Operation      | Time Complexity |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Find Max/Min   | O(1)            |
| Insert         | O(log n)        |
| Extract Max/Min| O(log n)        |
| Heapify        | O(n)            |

### Applications

1. **Heap Sort**: An efficient sorting algorithm with O(n log n) time complexity
2. **Priority Queue**: A data structure where the highest (or lowest) priority element is always removed first

## Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees

When elements are inserted into a BST in sorted order, the tree can degenerate into a linked list, resulting in O(n) time complexity for operations instead of O(log n).

Self-balancing BSTs automatically keep their height balanced after insertions and deletions:

### AVL Trees

- Named after inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis
- Maintains the property that for every node, the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most 1
- Uses rotation operations to maintain balance

### Red-Black Trees

- Each node is colored either red or black
- The root and leaves (NIL nodes) are black
- If a node is red, both its children are black
- All paths from a node to its NIL descendants contain the same number of black nodes
- Used in many standard library implementations (like `std::map` and `std::set`)

### Comparison

| Tree Type         | Insert     | Delete     | Search     | Space     |
|-------------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| **Unbalanced BST**| O(n)       | O(n)       | O(n)       | O(n)      |
| **AVL Tree**      | O(log n)   | O(log n)   | O(log n)   | O(n)      |
| **Red-Black Tree**| O(log n)   | O(log n)   | O(log n)   | O(n)      |

AVL trees maintain stricter balance than Red-Black trees, resulting in faster lookups but slower insertions and deletions due to more frequent rotations.

## C++ Standard Library Implementations

The C++ Standard Library includes several tree-based data structures:

- `std::set`: A collection of unique keys, sorted by keys (typically implemented as a Red-Black Tree)
- `std::map`: A collection of key-value pairs, sorted by keys (typically implemented as a Red-Black Tree)
- `std::multiset`: A collection of keys, sorted by keys, allows duplicate keys
- `std::multimap`: A collection of key-value pairs, sorted by keys, allows duplicate keys

Example usage:
```cpp
std::set<int> setInt;
setInt.insert(1);
setInt.insert(5);
setInt.insert(3);

// Iterating will access elements in sorted order (1, 3, 5)
for(std::set<int>::iterator setIter = setInt.begin(); 
    setIter != setInt.end(); 
    ++setIter)
{
    std::cout << *setIter << std::endl;
}
```

## Interview Questions

**Q: What is the difference between a complete binary tree and a perfect binary tree?**  
A: A complete binary tree fills levels from left to right, with all levels except possibly the last completely filled, and the last level has nodes as far left as possible. A perfect binary tree is a complete binary tree where all levels are fully filled—all internal nodes have exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

**Q: In a binary search tree, how would you find the in-order successor of a given node?**  
A: If the node has a right child, the in-order successor is the leftmost node in its right subtree. If it doesn't have a right child, the in-order successor is the lowest ancestor whose left child is also an ancestor of the given node.

**Q: What happens to a BST's performance if you insert elements in sorted order?**  
A: If elements are inserted in sorted order (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the BST degenerates into a linked list, and the time complexity for operations becomes O(n) instead of O(log n). This is why self-balancing trees like AVL or Red-Black trees are important for maintaining logarithmic performance.

**Q: How is a heap different from a binary search tree?**  
A: A heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property (parent values are greater/less than child values), optimized for finding min/max values quickly. A BST maintains left subtree values < node value < right subtree values, optimized for searching. Heaps are typically implemented using arrays, while BSTs use node structures with pointers.

**Q: Why might you choose a Red-Black tree over an AVL tree?**  
A: Red-Black trees perform fewer rotations during insertion and deletion compared to AVL trees, making them more efficient for applications with frequent modifications. AVL trees maintain stricter balance, making them slightly better for read-heavy applications. Standard library containers like `std::map` and `std::set` typically use Red-Black trees for this reason.

**Q: What is the time complexity of each tree traversal method?**  
A: All four traversal methods (pre-order, in-order, post-order, and level-order) have O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node must be visited exactly once.

**Q: How would you implement level-order traversal of a binary tree?**  
A: Level-order traversal can be implemented using a queue. Start by enqueuing the root node. Then, while the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, process it, and enqueue its children (if any). This process continues until the queue is empty.

## Tree Terminology and Structure

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Unlike graphs, trees cannot contain cycles.

### Basic Components:

- **Root Node**: The topmost node without any parent
- **Leaf Node**: Any node without children
- **Internal Node**: A node with at least one child

In graph terminology, the highest node is referred to as a vertex, but in trees, the parentless top node is specifically called the root.

### Binary Tree Types

A binary tree restricts each node to have at most two children. Several specialized forms exist:

- **Complete Binary Tree (CBT)**: Nodes are filled from left to right at each level before moving down
- **Perfect Binary Tree**: A CBT where all levels are completely filled

It's important to note that a perfect binary tree is a state of a complete binary tree, not a separate structure.

## Binary Search Trees (BST)

Binary search trees maintain a specific ordering property:
- All values in a node's left subtree are less than the node's value
- All values in a node's right subtree are greater than the node's value

This property makes BSTs excellent for searching operations, as each comparison eliminates half of the remaining elements.

### Performance Comparison

| Structure          | Insert     | Indexing   | Delete     | Search     |
|--------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Dynamic Array**  | O(1)       | O(1)       | O(n)       | O(n)       |
| **Linked List**    | O(1)       | O(n)       | O(1)       | O(n)       |
| **BST**            | O(log n)   | O(n)       | O(log n)   | O(log n)   |

C++ Standard Library implementations:
- `std::vector`: Dynamic array
- `std::list`: Linked list
- `std::set`, `std::map`: Binary search trees (typically Red-Black trees)

## Tree Traversal Methods

The four main ways to traverse a tree are:

### 1. Pre-Order (Node-Left-Right)
Visit the current node first, then traverse left subtree, then right subtree.
Useful for creating a copy of the tree.

### 2. In-Order (Left-Node-Right)
Traverse left subtree, visit the current node, then traverse right subtree.
For BSTs, this produces elements in sorted order.

### 3. Post-Order (Left-Right-Node)
Traverse left subtree, traverse right subtree, then visit the current node.
Useful when deleting nodes or freeing memory.

### 4. Level-Order (Breadth-First)
Visit nodes level by level from top to bottom.
Typically implemented using a queue.

### Example

```
Given the tree:
    A
   / \
  B   C
 / \ / 
D  E F

Pre-Order:   A → B → D → E → C → F
In-Order:    D → B → E → A → F → C
Post-Order:  D → E → B → F → C → A
Level-Order: A → B → C → D → E → F
```

## Heap Data Structures

Heaps are specialized complete binary trees that satisfy a specific property:
- **Min-heap**: Parent values are less than or equal to child values
- **Max-heap**: Parent values are greater than or equal to child values

Heaps can be efficiently implemented using arrays, where for a node at index `k`:
- Left child: `2k + 1`
- Right child: `2k + 2`
- Parent: `(k - 1) / 2`

This property allows heaps to be implemented without pointers, using array indexing instead.

### Applications

- **Heap Sort**: An efficient O(n log n) sorting algorithm
- **Priority Queue**: Data structure where the highest priority element is always removed first

## Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees

A major weakness of BSTs is that they can degenerate into linked lists if data is inserted in sorted order, reducing operation efficiency from O(log n) to O(n).

Self-balancing trees address this issue:

- **AVL Trees**: Maintain strict balance where subtree heights differ by at most 1
- **Red-Black Trees**: Use color properties to maintain balance with fewer rotations

Red-Black trees are commonly used in library implementations like `std::map` and `std::set` because they require fewer rotations than AVL trees, making them more efficient for insertions and deletions.

## Interview Questions

**Q: What is the difference between a complete binary tree and a perfect binary tree?**  
A: A complete binary tree fills all levels from left to right before moving to the next level, with the last level potentially partially filled (but filled from left). A perfect binary tree is a complete binary tree where all levels are fully filled—all internal nodes have exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

**Q: How would you implement level-order traversal of a binary tree?**  
A: Level-order traversal can be implemented using a queue. Start by enqueuing the root. While the queue isn't empty, dequeue a node, process it, and enqueue its children. This continues until the queue is empty.

**Q: What happens to a BST's performance if you insert elements in sorted order?**  
A: If elements are inserted in sorted order (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the BST degenerates into a linked list, and the time complexity becomes O(n) instead of O(log n). This is why self-balancing trees are important for maintaining logarithmic performance.

**Q: How is a heap different from a binary search tree?**  
A: A heap is a complete binary tree satisfying the heap property (parent values are greater/less than child values), optimized for finding min/max values quickly. A BST maintains left < node < right ordering for all nodes, optimized for searching. Heaps are typically implemented using arrays, while BSTs use node structures with pointers.

**Q: In a binary search tree, how would you find the in-order successor of a given node?**  
A: If the node has a right child, the in-order successor is the leftmost node in its right subtree. If it doesn't have a right child, the in-order successor is the lowest ancestor whose left child is also an ancestor of the given node.

**Q: Why might you choose a Red-Black tree over an AVL tree?**  
A: Red-Black trees perform fewer rotations during insertion and deletion compared to AVL trees, making them more efficient for applications with frequent modifications. AVL trees maintain stricter balance, making them slightly better for read-heavy applications.

**Q: Why is in-order traversal particularly important for binary search trees?**  
A: In-order traversal of a BST visits nodes in sorted order (ascending). This property makes it useful for producing a sorted list of all elements in the tree and is why iterators in `std::set` and `std::map` follow in-order traversal.
