Tree Algorithm 

Tree Traversal meaning ? 
Graph Circle / Cycle meaning ? 

Root Node of the Tree, the highest part 
In Graph, Highest Node is not only Root Node but also Vertex Node 
Anyway Parentless Tree Node is Root Node only 

In Graph, Nodes without childeren are called as Leaf Node 

If Tree MUST have two children in maximum, it is called as binary tree 
In Binary Tree, if there exist rule to fill only the left part first or right part first 
it is called as Complete Binary Tree 

If Complete Binary Tree is Full, meaing all elements are complete in current state, 
It is Perfect Binary Tree. 
Complete Binary Tree can exist as algorithm structure, but Perfect Binary Tree is just status 

Heap Data Structure exists min and max, good to find min max value quickly. Heap Sort is based on this. 
Heap is based on Complete Binary Tree. 
Priority Queue is also Heap Data Structure Based, aka Complete Binary Tree. 

Assignment Make Heap, Complete Binary Tree by CPP. 

Characteristic of Complete Binary Tree 
If CBT is implemented by C++, it is similar to linked list? 

But Heap is possible to implement inside sequential dynamic array 
idx k 
2k + 1 (Find Children)
(k - 1)/2 (Find Parents), for k = 6, (k-1)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 = 2 
(5-1)/2 -> 4 / 2 = 2 for k=5, directly find parents 
for k = 0, 2k + 1 = 1, at arr[1];  

0
1
2 
3 2k+1 
4 2k+2 
5
6
7 

Possible to find by indexing 
Only tree that is implemented as sequential array. 

Complete Binarry Tree From left child o right child fill each level to go to next level 
Index calculation by left kid 2k+1, right kid 2k+2, parent ((k-1)/2) 

CBT -> Heap - greatest at min max value finding 
Heap sort heap data structure based sorting 
Priority Queue the highest priority first popped up data structure 

Binary Search Tree 
Condition 1. Data must be sorted in order - data input process is related to sorting. 
    Data input process is related to sorting 
    First input data will be set as root 
    if input data is smaller than node move onto left, bigger onto right 
    In Order Traversal, then accessible by the sorted order 

Condition 2. Want Data Search begins from root node 
    If finding data is smaller than node data search let bigger search right continue 

        
                    Input       Indexing  Insert/Delete Search 
Dynamic Array       O(1)        O(1)      O(n)          O(n) - Sequential Search
Linked List         O(1)        O(n)      O(1)          O(n) - Sequential Search
Binary Search Tree  O(log n)    O(n)      O(1)          O(log n) - Binary Search 

1 > log n >>>> n 

BST Algorithm 

std::vector = Dynamic Array 
std::list = linked list 
std::set = Binary Search Tree 
std::map = Binary Search Tree with key for search and value 

Even though data insertion order is random, each input sorts the entire array 
set<int> setInt; 
setInt.insert(1); 
set<int>::iterator setIter = setInt.begin(); 

for(; setIter != setInt.end(); ++setIter)
{
    cout << *setIter << endl; 
}

C++ Implementation of Vector List Stack Queue Deque Heap(CBT) BST 
Binary Tree 4 Traversal methods 
Pre Order 
In  Order 
Post Order 
Level Order 
In Binary Search Tree Only In Order Traversal is Used 
All Binary Trees are able to use these 4 

   A
  / \
 B   C
/ \ / 
D E F
Pre Order  A > B > D > E > C > F Node - Left - Right 
In Order   D > B > E > A > F > C Left - Node - Right 
Post Order D > E > B > F > C > A Left - Right - Node 
Level Order A > B > C > D > E > F 

In Order Traversal Sequential from left to right in order 
iterator inside set and map iterate in order. begin iterator will point first, the leftest one. 

In Order Tree Traversal 
In Order Successor 
In Order Predecessor 

Big Problem of BST 
Data input order might decrease efficiency a lot 
If input is from 1 to 1000, it is basically same as linked list so gets O(n) efficiency 
Thus tree should balance to maintain log n efficiency. 

Thus, balance maintaining function is required. 
Binary Search Tree =>Self Balanced Binary Search Tree 
AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree are BST based and has function to alter tree structure to make balance
