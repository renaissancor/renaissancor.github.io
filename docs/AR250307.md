# Control Flow in C++

## Key Points

- Control flow directs the order of execution in programs.
- `if`, `else if`, `else` allow conditional execution.
- `switch-case` enables value-based branching.
- Logical expressions (`&&`, `||`, `!`) are key in decision making.
- Only the first satisfied condition in `if-else if` chain is executed.

## Overview

Control flow determines which parts of code get executed and in what order. It is essential for making decisions, handling conditions, and branching logic. In C++, control flow constructs include conditional statements like `if`, `else if`, `else`, and multi-way branching using `switch-case`.

## Conditional Statements

### If, Else If, Else

```cpp
int HP = 0;

// If HP is greater than 80
if (80 < HP) {
    int a = 0;
}
// If HP is greater than 60 but less than or equal to 80
else if (60 < HP) {
    int a = 0;
}
// If HP is greater than 40 but less than or equal to 60
else if (40 < HP) {
    int a = 0;
}
// If HP is greater than 20 but less than or equal to 40
else if (20 < HP) {
    int a = 0;
}
// If all above conditions fail
else {
    int a = 0;
}
```

- `else if` conditions are only checked if previous ones fail.
- Only one block will execute in a single `if-else if-else` chain.
- If you want all conditions checked independently, use separate `if` statements.

### Logical Operators in Conditions

```cpp
int IsTrue = 10 && 0;    // false
IsTrue = 1 || 0;         // true
IsTrue = !IsTrue;        // false
```

- `&&` (logical AND) returns true if both operands are true.
- `||` (logical OR) returns true if at least one operand is true.
- `!` (logical NOT) inverts the boolean value.

## Interview Questions

**Q: What is the difference between `if-else if` and multiple `if` statements?**  
A: In `if-else if`, only the first true condition is executed; remaining conditions are skipped. Multiple `if` statements are evaluated independently.

**Q: What happens if multiple `else if` conditions are true?**  
A: Only the first true conditionâ€™s block is executed; the rest are ignored.

**Q: How does short-circuiting work in logical expressions?**  
A: In expressions like `a && b`, if `a` is false, `b` is not evaluated. Similarly, in `a || b`, if `a` is true, `b` is skipped.
