iterator 


CArray<int>::iterator arrIter = arrInt.begin(); 

*(arrIter++); 

*(++arrIter); 

operator ++ 
should return iterator instead of void 
Return this pointer

iterator &operator++

int value = *(++arrIter); 

// Prefix Operator 
iterator& operator ++(int _Data)
{
    iterator copyiter(*this); //  
    ++(*this);
    return copyiter; // \
}

// Postfix Iterator 
iterator operator ++(int _Data) // If you return reference, copy iterator will be terminated after this scope 
{ // Since copyiter will be deleted after this function, dont call reference for this 
    iterator copyiter(*this); // Same as the calling this 
    ++(*this); // Next pointer will be targeted 
    // calling iterator itself will increment, while the original position is saved as copy iterator  

    return copyiter; 
}

default terminator is created automatically 
default copy operator is also created automatically 

class iterator

private: 
    CArray<T>* 
}

Optimization 
vector iterator from begin to end 
iter = vec.begin(); iter != vec.end(); ++iter // ++iter is faster than iter++ 
Because postfix should temporarily make two more temporal variables inside loop 
Sicne ++iter and iter++ mean same in the for loop for most cases 
Thus, use ++iter rather than iter++ 
So use prefix rather than postfix. 

iterator& operator --()
{
    return *this; 
} 
iterator operator --(int)
{
    return *this; 
}

Based on ++ iterator

class VS struct - When to use what ? 

```cpp 
template<typename T>
struct tNode 
{
    T           m_Data; 
    // tNode<T>*   m_Prev; Originally this, but simpllified as below 
    tNode*      m_Prev; 
    tNode*      m_Next; 

public: 
    tNode() // Default generator inputs trash value, instead of 0 nullptr to data and pointer 
        : m_Data() // this calls the DEFAULT Generator of typename T. For instance, int will give 0. 
        , m_Next(nullptr)
        , m_Prev(nullptr)
    {}

    tNode(T _Data, tNode<T>* _Next, tNode<T>* _Prev)
        : m_Data(_Data)
        , m_Next(_Next)
        , m_Prev(_Prev) 
    {}
}

template<typename T>
class CList
{
private: 
    tNode<T>*       m_Head; 
    tNode<T>*       m_Tail; 
    unsigned int    m_Size; 
public: 
    void push_back(const T& _Data); // Data Type Size is not sure  
    void push_front(const T& _Data); 

    CList():
        m_Head(nullptr), 
        m_Tail(nullptr), 
        m_Size(nullptr)
        {}
    ~CList()
    {
        tNode<T>* pNode = m_Head; 
        for loop 
    }
}

template<typename T>
void CList<T>::push_back()
{
    tNode<T>* pNewNode = new tNode<T>; 


    if(nullptr == m_Head)
    {}
    // If Data is First 
    else
    {}

    // If Not 
}

```

Generally list figured out node from head to tail by next node next node ... 
Since tail pointer is also available right now 
push_back and push_front will be both O(1). 
Without tail pointer push_back will be O(n). 

List connects tail pointing node and newly generated node. 
Newly generated node will be pushed back and setted as tail. 

Newly generated node into the new head 
if data size is over one, aka m_Next of head exists instead of nullptr 
Original head node, now second node, should set is prev node from nullptr to new head 

finally, data size counting reset. 


inner class iterator in my linkedlist CList 

private: CList<T> *m_Owner; 
List knows iterator, and save index and starting point ...
For vector and dynamic array it is O(1) by index adding with starting point, because they save by sequential array 
But for list it is O(n) in the worst case, as it should move to next pointer between 1 and n times 
Thus, list iterator should point out the target node, not the owner starting point 
iterator is poniting nothing if m_Owner == nullptr ** m_target_node == nullptr, iterator is inside not created list  
but if m_Owner != nullptr and m_target_node == nullptr, this represents iterator is at end(), while list is valid. 

if iterator is pointing nothing or end iterator moving iterator from target node to next node is impossible so assert(targetNode) for nullptr. 
doing ++ at tail iterator will be fine, but end, which is nullptr would be unlikely for ++ iterator. 

CList Template Class gneration 

CList::iterator ++ == != operator 
Postfix, erase, etc.
