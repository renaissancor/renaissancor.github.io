# Linked List and Dynamic Array 

### Date: 2025-03-28

## Key Points

- Linked lists enable constant time insertion at the front (`O(1)`), but traversal and indexing are linear (`O(N)`).
- Dynamic arrays allow fast indexing (`O(1)`), but insertion can require memory reallocation (`O(N)` worst case).
- Big-O notation is used to describe algorithm efficiency in terms of input size.
- Memory management is crucial: always `free()` dynamically allocated memory to avoid leaks.
- Debug flags like `_CRTDBG_LEAK_CHECK_DF` can help identify memory leaks in development.

## Overview

This example demonstrates dynamic memory management through a basic implementation of a **dynamic array** and a **singly linked list**. Key focus areas include:

- Dynamic allocation using `malloc`
- Linked list operations: `PushBack`, `PushFront`, and `Release`
- Manual memory management and debugging practices

## Dynamic Array

The array expands dynamically when capacity is exceeded:

```cpp
void PushBack(tArray* _pArr, int _Data) {
    if (_pArr->Size == _pArr->Capacity) {
        int* pNew = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * _pArr->Capacity * 2);
        for (int i = 0; i < _pArr->Size; ++i) {
            pNew[i] = _pArr->pArr[i];
        }
        free(_pArr->pArr);
        _pArr->pArr = pNew;
        _pArr->Capacity *= 2;
    }
    _pArr->pArr[_pArr->Size++] = _Data;
}
```

This ensures capacity is doubled when full, mimicking vector-like behavior.

## Linked List

The list supports inserting data at both the front and the back:

```cpp
void PushBack(tList* _List, int _Data) {
    tNode* pNode = (tNode*)malloc(sizeof(tNode));
    pNode->Data = _Data;
    pNode->pNext = nullptr;

    if (_List->pHead == nullptr) {
        _List->pHead = pNode;
    } else {
        tNode* pLast = _List->pHead;
        while (pLast->pNext != nullptr) {
            pLast = pLast->pNext;
        }
        pLast->pNext = pNode;
    }
    ++_List->Size;
}
```

```cpp
void PushFront(tList* _List, int _Data) {
    tNode* pNewNode = (tNode*)malloc(sizeof(tNode));
    pNewNode->Data = _Data;
    pNewNode->pNext = _List->pHead;
    _List->pHead = pNewNode;
    ++_List->Size;
}
```

---

## Memory Management

Every dynamic allocation must be paired with a corresponding deallocation to prevent memory leaks:

```cpp
void Release(tList* _List) {
    tNode* pNode = _List->pHead;
    while (pNode != nullptr) {
        tNode* pNext = pNode->pNext;
        free(pNode);
        pNode = pNext;
    }
    _List->pHead = nullptr;
    _List->Size = 0;
}
```

Enable memory leak checks in Visual Studio with:

```cpp
_CrtSetDbgFlag(_CRTDBG_ALLOC_MEM_DF | _CRTDBG_LEAK_CHECK_DF);
```

---

## Common Mistakes

**Accessing Freed Memory**
```cpp
Release(&list);
list.pHead->Data = 5;  // Undefined behavior!
```
Always reset pointers after `free` or inside cleanup functions.

**Forgetting to Resize Dynamic Arrays**
```cpp
// Incorrect usage - no resize logic
arr.pArr[arr.Size++] = 999;  // May cause heap corruption
```
Always check and resize when adding elements.

---

## Tricky Case: Memory Debugging

When using `_CrtSetDbgFlag`, memory leaks are printed automatically at the end of program execution in debug mode.
This is particularly useful when working with dynamic structures like linked lists.

## Interview Questions

**Q: When would you choose a linked list over a dynamic array?**  
A: When frequent insertions/removals at the beginning or middle of the collection are required. Linked lists allow `O(1)` front insertion, unlike arrays which require shifting elements.

**Q: Why is it dangerous to access memory after freeing it?**  
A: The memory region may be reassigned or invalidated, leading to undefined behavior or program crashes.

**Q: What happens when you forget to `free()` dynamically allocated memory?**  
A: It results in a memory leak, which can cause performance degradation over time.

**Q: Why does `malloc` return `void*`?**  
A: Because `malloc` doesn't know the target type. It returns a generic pointer that must be cast by the programmer.

**Q: What is the time complexity of inserting at the end of a singly linked list?**  
A: `O(N)`, unless a tail pointer is maintained, in which case it becomes `O(1)`.

## Code Demonstration Output

```cpp
// list2 stores 300, 200, 100 via PushFront()
tNode* pNode = list2.pHead;
while (pNode) {
    printf("%d\n", pNode->Data);
    pNode = pNode->pNext;
}
```

Expected output:
```
300
200
100
```
