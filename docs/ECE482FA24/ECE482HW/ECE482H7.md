## Ex. 1 — Page replacement algorithm

In this exercise we consider the WSClock page replacement algorithm with a τ value of two ticks.
The system state is given as follows.

| Page | Time Stamp | Present | Referenced | Modified |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 0    | 6          | 1       | 0          | 1        |
| 1    | 9          | 1       | 1          | 0        |
| 2    | 9          | 1       | 1          | 1        |
| 3    | 7          | 1       | 0          | 0        |
| 4    | 4          | 0       | 0          | 0        |

### Ex. 1.1. Explain the content of the new table entries if a clock interrupt occurs at tick 10.

Page 0, `Time Stamp` $= 6 \leq 8$, old,
`Referenced` $=0$, Replacement candidate,
`Modified` $=1$, Should be written in disk.

Page 1, `Time Stamp` $= 9 \geq 8$, Not old, No change

Page 2, `Time Stamp` $= 9 \geq 8$, Not old, No change

Page 3, `Time Stamp` $= 7 \leq 8$, old,
Replacement candidate, with no need to write back to disk

Page 4, `Present `$=0$, so not in memory, not considered for replacement

Table after Tick 10 interrupt is following.

| Page | Time Stamp | Present | Referenced | Modified |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 0    | 6          | 1       | 0          | 0        |
| 1    | 9          | 1       | 1          | 0        |
| 2    | 9          | 1       | 1          | 1        |
| 3    | 7          | 1       | 0          | 0        |
| 4    | 4          | 0       | 0          | 0        |

### Ex. 1.2. Due to a read request to page 4 a page fault occurs at tick 10. Describe the new table entry.

Suppose read request for page 4 is made.
Since `Present` = 0, page is not in memory. Page Fault.

WSLock Algorithm

First, select victim page. For page 3,
`Time Stamp` $= 7 \leq 8$, old,
`Referenced `$=0$, `Modified `$=0$, No need to write back in disk.

Now remove page 3 and load page 4.
Update `Present` $=1$, `Referenced `$=0$, `Modified `$=0$.
Result table will be following.

| Page | Time Stamp | Present | Referenced | Modified |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 0    | 6          | 1       | 0          | 0        |
| 1    | 9          | 1       | 1          | 0        |
| 2    | 9          | 1       | 1          | 1        |
| 3    | 7          | 0       | 0          | 0        |
| 4    | 10         | 1       | 0          | 0        |

## Ex. 2 — Minix 3

The goal of this exercise is to understand and implement system calls.

### Ex. 2.1. In which files are:

#### a) the constants with number and name for the system calls?

Path is `/include/minix/callnr.h`

#### b) the names of the system call routines?

`/servers/*/table.c`

#### c) the prototypes of the system call routines?

`/servers/*/proto.h`

#### d) the system calls of type “signal” coded?

`/servers/pm/signal.c`

### Ex. 2.2. What problems arise when trying to implement a system call int getchpids(int n, pid_t \*childpid)

#### which “writes” the pids of up to n children of the current process into \*childpid?

- Since `*childpid` is located in user space, kernel code will not directly access to user space pointers
- Secure copy mechanism (`sys_datacopy`) is required.
- Validate Buffer size sufficiency to handle `n` child PIDs.
- Concurrent issue appears when process create or remove children during execution.

### Ex. 2.3. Write a “sub-system call” int getnchpid(int n, pid_t childpid) which retrieves the n-th child process.

```c
#include "pm.h"
#include "mproc.h"

int getnchpid(int n, pid_t *childpid) {
    if (childpid == NULL) return -1;
    if (n >= NR_PROCS) return -1;

    struct mproc *child = &mproc[n];
    if (child->mp_parent != who_p) return -1;    // Ensure the process is a child of caller

    *childpid = child->mp_pid;                    // Retrieve PID of the child
    return 0;
}
```

### Ex. 2.4. Using the previous sub-system call, implement the original getchpids system call.

#### The returned int value corresponds to the number of pids in \*childpid, or -1 on an error.

```c
#include "pm.h"
#include "mproc.h"

int do_getchpids(int n, pid_t *childpid) {
    if (childpid == NULL) return -1;
    if (n > NR_PROCS) return -1;

    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int result = getnchpid(i, &childpid[i]);
        if (result == -1) break;  // Stop if no more children
        count++;
    }
    return count;                 // Return children retrieved count
}
```

### Ex. 2.5. Write a short program that demonstrate the previous system calls.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

#define NUM 10  // Number of child processes to create

int main() {
    pid_t child_pids[NUM];
    pid_t retrieved_pids[NUM];

    // Create child processes
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM; i++) {
        pid_t pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) { // Child process
            printf("Child %d: PID = %d\n", i, getpid());
            exit(0);
        } else if (pid > 0) { // Parent process
            child_pids[i] = pid;
        } else {
            perror("fork failed");
            exit(1);
        }
    }

    // Wait for all child processes to terminate
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM; i++) {
        wait(NULL);
    }

    // Call `getchpids` to retrieve child PIDs
    int result = getchpids(NUM, retrieved_pids);
    if (result < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "getchpids fail\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Validate and print results
    for (int i = 0; i < result; i++) {
        printf("Retrieved PID: %d\n", retrieved_pids[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Ex. 2.6. The above strategy solves the initial problem through the introduction of a sub-system call.

#### a) What are the drawbacks and benefits of this solution?

**Drawbacks**:

- Additional overhead due to multiple calls to `getnchpid`.
- Complexity in handling edge cases (e.g., invalid indices).
- Higher potential for race conditions.

**Benefits**:

- Modular design makes debugging easier.
- Reusability of the `getnchpid` function.

#### b) Without implementing it, describe the basic details of an alternative approach.

Implement `getchpids` as single system call

- Iteration through the process table in one pass.
- Retrieval of all child PIDs directly into user-provided buffer.

## Ex. 3 — Research

### Write about a page on the topic of the ext2 filesystem. Do not forget to reference your sources.

Second Extended File System, or ext2 file system is a non-journaling filesystem
introduced in 1993 for Linux. It was designed to overcome the limit of
the ext filesystem by improving performance, flexibility, and scalability.
due to its simplicity and efficiency, ext2 is still used for certain applications.
Key components of ext2 are followings.

- **Superblock** contains filesystem metadata, its size, block num, inodes, etc
- **Inode Table** represent file or directory and contain information like size, owner, timestamp, etc
- **Data Blocks** save file contents. Large files are supported by indirect, double indirect, etc.
- **Block Group** divide filesystem to block group, each containing inode table, data block, etc.

Since ext2 does not use journaling, overhead is reduced and writing speed is faster
than later generation filesystems like ext3 or ext4 sometimes.
This make it appropriate for devices with limited resources like USB or embedded systems.
Its flexible inode allocation system allow optimized work performance with
large quantity of volumes, even up to 2TB in size on 4KB block systems at maximum.

However, absence of journaling represents crash or system power fail will
require `fsck` check to restart. It might compromise data, and much slower.
Also, its workload is not enough to handle huge quantity of volumes nowadays.

- "Understanding Linux Filesystems" - https://tldp.org
- Linux terminal man pages (man ext2, man fsck).

## Ex. 4 — Simple questions

### Ex. 4.1. If a page is shared between two processes,

#### is it possible that the page is read-only for one process and read-write for the other? Why or why not?

Yes. Memory Management Unit (MMU) will enforce access permission based on page table of each process.
One process will map page for read only, and other process will map as read and write.

### Ex. 4.2. When both paging and segmentation are being used,

#### first the segment descriptor is found and then the page descriptor. Does the TLB also need a two-levels lookup?

No. TLB will not need two process layers. TLB acquire virtual to physical transition
after page lookup and full segment. TLB will miss trigger two level lookup to update TLB.
