## Documentation Plan

1. Lottery Scheduling overview, key principles
2. Code structure design choices and explanations
3. Testing tools and methodologies in function, performance, edge cases
4. Test result summary and performance analysis of throughput and latency


### Development Strategies

#### Task List
1. **Lottery Scheduling - 6 hours**
2. **Solve Simple Investigation Questions - 1 hours**
3. **Test Program for Lottery - 15 hours**

#### 1. **Lottery Scheduling**
- **Action Plan**:
  - Study the basic principles of lottery scheduling and its implementation.
  - Write the initial scheduling algorithm code and test its performance under various loads.
  - Debug and optimize the code to ensure stability and efficiency in a multitasking environment.
  
- **Difficulty Evaluation**:  
  High. Our major task

- **Time Estimation**:  
  Estimated to take 6 hours:  
  - Research and design: 1 hours  
  - Code implementation: 3 hours  
  - Debugging and optimization: 2 hours


#### 2. **Test Program for Lottery**
- **Action Plan**:
  - Write test cases to cover different scheduling scenarios.
  - Run the tests and record the results to verify the correctness of the lottery scheduling algorithm.
  - Conduct performance testing to ensure the algorithm performs well under different loads.

- **Difficulty Evaluation**:  
  Medium. Would be very fast if our original design is good enough.

- **Time Estimation**:  
  Estimated to take 2 hours:  
  - Write test cases: 0.5 hours  
  - Execute tests and record results: 1.5 hours  
  - Debugging and fixing issues: it depends
