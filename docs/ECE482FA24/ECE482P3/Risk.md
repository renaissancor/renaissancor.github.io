## Risk Categories

### 1. **Technical Risks**
- **Complexity of Algorithm**: Difficulty in implementing a fair and efficient lottery scheduling algorithm.  
  *Mitigation*: Break down tasks and perform early unit tests.

- **Performance under Load**: The algorithm may degrade as the number of processes increases.  
  *Mitigation*: Test with varying loads and optimize ticket distribution.

### 2. **Operational Risks**
- **Time Constraints**: Limited time may delay progress.  
  *Mitigation*: Use a structured timeline and monitor progress regularly.

- **Testing Complexity**: Difficulty in creating comprehensive test cases for a probabilistic algorithm.  
  *Mitigation*: Develop a broad set of test cases and automate tests.

### 3. **Human Resource Risks**
- **Lack of Expertise**: Team members may be unfamiliar with eBPF or kernel programming.  
  *Mitigation*: Allocate time for training and practice.

### 4. **External Risks**
- **System Compatibility**: Compatibility issues with the testing environment.  
  *Mitigation*: Ensure portability and test on multiple platforms, like ubuntu, arch, etc.
