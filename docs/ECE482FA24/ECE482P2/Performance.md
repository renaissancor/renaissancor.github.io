## Performance Analysis Overview 

How multi-threading, query optimization, and efficient resource allocation
improved overall system throughput and responsiveness will be recorded.

Key observations from the timing log:
- **Baseline Performance**: The original system's performance metrics were extracted to serve as a benchmark.
- **Improved Metrics**:
    - Execution times have been significantly reduced across all query types.
    - Parallel query handling demonstrates efficient core utilization with minimal overhead.
    - The system scales effectively with the number of cores, as verified on the 64-core test server.

## Log Insights
### Timing Highlights
Below are the key timing statistics derived from the log:

| **Query Type**       | **sample lemondb Time (ms)** | **our lemondb Time (ms)** | **Improvement (%)** |
|----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| many_insert_delete   | 18021                        | 5446.0                    | 230.9               |
| many_read            | 18899                        | 5386                      | 250.1               |
| few_insert_delete    | 15708                        | 5538                      | 183.6               |
| few_read             | 23977                        | 7145                      | 235.6               |
| single_insert_delete | 29316                        | 23434                     | 25.1                |
| single_read          | 38493                        | 28934                     | 33.0                |


## Optimization Techniques
1. **Multi-threading**:
    - Implemented parallel query execution.
    - Dynamically allocated threads using the `--threads` argument.
2. **Resource Management**:
    - Improved memory allocation and reallocation strategies.
    - Minimized contention and avoided deadlocks.
3. **Query Parsing Enhancements**:
    - Optimized ID assignment for continuous integer sequences.
4. **Core Utilization**:
    - Auto-detection of available cores for `--threads=0`.

## Next Steps
- Continue profiling to identify edge cases that may impact performance.
- Explore advanced optimizations (e.g., thread pooling, asynchronous I/O).
- Document any additional improvements in subsequent updates.
