# Operators and Precedence

## Key Points

- Operators perform computations on variables and values.
- Operator precedence determines evaluation order in expressions.
- C++ includes arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and increment/decrement operators.

---

## Arithmetic Operators

```cpp
int a = 10, b = 3;

int sum = a + b;    // 13
int diff = a - b;   // 7
int prod = a * b;   // 30
int div = a / b;    // 3 (integer division)
int mod = a % b;    // 1 (remainder)
```

- When both operands are integers, division truncates the result.
- `%` is only applicable to integers.

---

## Floating-Point Division

```cpp
float fdiv = 10.f / 3.f;    // 3.333...
double ddiv = 10.0 / 3.0;   // 3.333...
```

- Floating-point division returns a more accurate result.

---

## Assignment Operator

```cpp
int x = 5;  // Assigns value 5 to x
```

- `=` assigns the right-hand side value to the left-hand variable.

---

## Increment and Decrement

```cpp
int num = 0;

++num; // Pre-increment: increment before use
--num; // Pre-decrement

num++; // Post-increment: use before increment
dec--; // Post-decrement

int result = num++;  // result gets old num; num is incremented afterward
```

- Pre-increment/decrement has higher precedence than post.
- Mixed with other expressions, they can affect evaluation order.

---

## Comparison Operators

```cpp
int a = 10, b = 20;

bool isEqual = (a == b);   // false
bool isNotEqual = (a != b);// true
bool isGreater = (a > b);  // false
bool isLessEqual = (a <= b); // true
```

- Always return boolean values: `true` or `false`.

---

## Boolean and Logical Operators

```cpp
bool result1 = true && false;  // false (AND)
bool result2 = true || false;  // true  (OR)
bool result3 = !true;          // false (NOT)
```

- `&&`, `||` use short-circuit evaluation.
- Only `0` is false; all non-zero integers are considered true.

---

## Operator Precedence Example

```cpp
int x = 10, y = 20;
bool result = x++ < y && y++ > 15;
```

- `x++ < y`: `x` is compared first, then incremented.
- `&&`: evaluates only if the first condition is true.
- `y++ > 15`: executed only if `x++ < y` is true.

---

## Tricky Case: Precedence Pitfall

```cpp
int i = 10;
int j = i++ * 2 + ++i;
```

Step-by-step evaluation:
- `i++` = 10 (then i becomes 11)
- `++i` = 12 (i becomes 12 before use)
- `j = 10 * 2 + 12 = 32`

## Interview Questions

**Q: What's the difference between `++i` and `i++`?**  
A: `++i` increments the value before it's used in the expression, while `i++` uses the current value and then increments.

**Q: What happens when mixing `&&`, `||`, and comparison operators in one expression?**  
A: C++ follows operator precedence rules: comparison operators are evaluated first, then logical AND (`&&`), then logical OR (`||`). Use parentheses for clarity.

**Q: What??™s short-circuit evaluation?**  
A: In logical expressions, `&&` stops evaluating if the first condition is false, and `||` stops if the first is true. This avoids unnecessary computation.
