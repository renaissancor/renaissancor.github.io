# Binary Search Tree Basic Structure 

Binary Search Tree even though 
data iteration by middle 

In Order Successor 
In Order Predecessor 

set map 
Red Black Tree 

set<int>

map<int, float> 
key, value . key is used for sorting 
The reason we use BST is to search data as fast as possible 
if set is used if no number inside 
Saved data is a sorting standard in set 
However inside map, key is the sorting standard 
Value data following for the second 

In BST perspective 

tBSTNode<T1,T2> * m_Root 
this must be writen inside BST class 

while when Node perspective 

tBSTNode * pParent 
tBSTNode * pLeftChild 
tBSTNode * pRightChild 

These are fine since Node itself would automatically convert and recognize it as 
tBSTNode<T1,T2> * pParent ... 

Remove function of the BST 
level iteration to remove it 
Use Queue Data Structure. Stack LIFO Queue FIFO 
Let's use CList implemented before. basically using pop_front only makes list as queue 

Inside BST Terminator ~BST(); 
CList<tBSTNode<T1, T2>*> queue; 
First input root node. 
In queue BST the first root node address type is input inside list 
while(queue.empty()) {}

Level Order Traversal terminator is possible by queue data structure iteration 
BFS Breadth first search 

If terminator using DFS is preferred, use stack data structure in tree traversal 

template 
my make pair template function to make pair 
template<typename T1, typename T2>
tBSTPair<T1, T2> MakePair (const T1 & _First, const T2 & _Second)
{
    tPair<T1, T2> pair; 
    pair.first = _First; 
    pair.second = _Second; 

    void insert(tPair<T1, T2> &_pair); 
}

this is template not function 

if nullptr == m_Root 

tree has never received input. get input as root, easy 

else // aka BST has at least one element 

When BST input is same as some node of the tree what happens to BST ? 
in STL, std::map IGNORES same value. did not push it. not even cause error. 

This might cause future problem 

input with originally same key, will not be input, so generated node will be lost. 
Even after terminator, that node will still exist resulting in memory leak. 

Thus, standard map do NOT notice whether key already exists inside and call assert. 
Key MUST BE unique inside std::set std::map. NO Duplicated key for tree. 
Duplicated Key will result in circumstances that do not allow 

Duplicated key is allowed when using standard library multi map 
std::multipmap<int, float> multimap 
They DO NOT call assert for failed input due to duplicated key input 

When same key input happens, then it makes same key node into list structure. 
So, multi map will make inside BST, same key will be saved as linked list. 
Thus, same key is not recommended.
