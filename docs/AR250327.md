# Dynamic Memory Allocation and Heap Management

## Key Points

- `malloc()` allocates memory in the **heap** based on the byte size.
- Always `free()` dynamically allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.
- The return type of `malloc()` is `void*` because it doesn't assume the type of allocated memory.
- Heap corruption can occur if memory is accessed beyond the allocated bounds.
- Using structures like dynamic arrays requires careful memory management.

## Overview

Dynamic memory allocation in C is a powerful tool that enables allocating memory at runtime using the heap. This is particularly useful for variable-sized data like dynamic arrays.

The functions `malloc()` and `free()` are essential:
- `malloc(size)` allocates `size` bytes and returns a pointer to the first byte.
- `free(ptr)` deallocates memory previously allocated with `malloc()`.

If memory is allocated and not freed, it leads to a **memory leak**, which can gradually consume all available memory.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    // Allocate 200 bytes in the heap
    void* pData = malloc(200);

    // Always free dynamically allocated memory
    free(pData);

    return 0;
}
```

## Dynamic Array Example

This sample shows how a custom dynamic array is used via a user-defined structure and helper functions (`InitArr`, `PushBack`).

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "Array.h"

int main()
{
    int iArr[10] = {}; // Static array

    tArray arr = {};   // Custom dynamic array
    InitArr(&arr);     // Initialize dynamic array

    // Push elements into dynamic array
    PushBack(&arr, 100);
    PushBack(&arr, 200);
    PushBack(&arr, 300);
    PushBack(&arr, 400);
    PushBack(&arr, 500);
    PushBack(&arr, 600);
    PushBack(&arr, 700);
    PushBack(&arr, 800);
    PushBack(&arr, 900);

    // Print all elements
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.Size; ++i)
    {
        printf("%d\n", arr.pArr[i]);
    }

    // Free the allocated memory to avoid memory leak
    free(arr.pArr);

    return 0;
}
```

## Common Mistakes

**Memory Leak**
```c
void* p = malloc(100);
// forgot to free(p); -> memory leak
```

**Heap Corruption**
```c
arr.pArr[1800] = 10; // Dangerous: Accessing memory beyond allocation
```
Accessing beyond the allocated size may corrupt memory and lead to unpredictable behavior. It may or may not crash the program, making it hard to detect.

## Tricky Case: Void Pointer and Casting

`malloc()` returns a `void*`, which must be cast to the appropriate type:

```c
int* pData = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
*pData = 10;
```
This makes the allocation flexible but puts the responsibility of correct usage on the programmer.

## Interview Questions

**Q: Why does `malloc()` return `void*`?**  
A: It returns `void*` to allow allocating memory for any data type. The caller casts the returned pointer to the appropriate type.

**Q: What happens if you forget to `free()` memory?**  
A: It results in a memory leak ? memory stays allocated until the program terminates, reducing available memory over time.

**Q: How can you prevent heap corruption?**  
A: Always ensure you access memory within the bounds of what you allocated. Use debugging tools like Valgrind or built-in runtime checks when available.

**Q: What's the difference between stack and heap allocation?**  
A: Stack allocation is automatic and limited in size, suitable for small, fixed-size data. Heap allocation is manual and allows large or dynamic-sized data but must be freed manually.

## Summary

Dynamic memory is key to flexible C programs. Functions like `malloc()` and `free()` provide control but demand responsibility. Mismanagement leads to memory leaks or heap corruption. Understanding how and when to allocate/deallocate memory is essential to writing safe and efficient code.
