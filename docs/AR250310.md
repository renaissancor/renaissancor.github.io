## Key Points

- Macros simplify complex or frequently-used expressions.
- Bitwise operators manipulate data at the bit level.
- Use `unsigned` types with bitwise operations to avoid signed behavior issues.
- Bit masks efficiently represent multiple boolean flags in a single variable.
- Combine and check bitwise states using `|`, `&`, `^`, `~`, and shift operators.

## Overview

C++ provides a rich set of **bitwise operators** that are useful for low-level programming tasks. When used correctly with `#define` macros, they can improve both code clarity and performance—especially in scenarios like setting and checking character statuses in games.

The `#define` preprocessor directive is used to define constants or macro functions that can simplify repetitive or verbose code patterns.

## Bit Mask Macros

```cpp
#define MY int
#define MAX_FLOOR 60

#define ATT_UP     0x1
#define DEF_UP     0x2
#define DEX_UP     0x4
#define SPEED_UP   0x8
#define ATT_DOWN   0x10
#define DEF_DOWN   0x20
#define DEX_DOWN   0x40
#define SPEED_DOWN 0x80

#define EVENT_POTION (ATT_UP | DEF_UP | DEX_UP | SPEED_UP)
```

These macros define constants using hexadecimal values where each constant represents a unique bit flag. `EVENT_POTION` combines several buffs using the bitwise OR operator (`|`).

## Bitwise Operators

### Left Shift (`<<`)
Doubles the value for each shift to the left.
```cpp
int a = 2 << 3; // a = 16 (2 * 2^3)
```

### Right Shift (`>>`)
Halves the value for each shift to the right.
```cpp
unsigned char c = 127;
c = c >> 1; // c = 63
```

Use `unsigned` types to avoid unexpected behavior due to sign bit propagation in signed integers.

## Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT

```cpp
unsigned char c1 = 10;   // 0000 1010
unsigned char c2 = 2;    // 0000 0010

unsigned char c3 = c1 & c2; // AND: 0000 0010
c3 = c1 | c2;               // OR:  0000 1010
c1 = ~c1;                   // NOT: 1111 0101 (bitwise inverse)
c3 = c1 ^ c2;               // XOR: 0000 1000
```

You can also use compound assignment operators for clarity:
```cpp
c3 += 2;  // Instead of: c3 = c3 + 2
```

## Character Status Flags

Use a single variable to hold multiple flags.

```cpp
unsigned long long CharStat = 0;

CharStat |= ATT_UP;
CharStat |= DEF_UP;
CharStat |= DEX_UP;
CharStat |= SPEED_UP;
```

Check if a flag is set:
```cpp
if (CharStat & DEF_UP) {
    // DEF_UP is active
}
```

Remove a flag using XOR (toggles the bit):
```cpp
if (CharStat & SPEED_UP) {
    CharStat ^= SPEED_UP;
}
```

Forcefully clear a flag using AND with NOT:
```cpp
CharStat &= ~SPEED_UP; // Clear SPEED_UP
```

Re-apply a predefined buff combination:
```cpp
CharStat |= EVENT_POTION;
```

## Tricky Case: Signed vs Unsigned Shift

Avoid right-shifting signed integers, as the behavior of sign bit propagation may differ between platforms.

```cpp
char c = -1;
c = c >> 1; // May retain sign bit (platform-dependent)

// Use unsigned instead:
unsigned char c = -1; // Interpreted as 255
c = c >> 1;           // Safe right shift
```

## Interview Questions

**Q: Why use `unsigned` types with bitwise operations?**  
A: Signed types may cause platform-dependent behavior during right shifts and logical operations due to sign bit extension. Unsigned ensures consistent results.

**Q: What’s the difference between `|`, `^`, and `&`?**  
A: `|` sets bits, `&` checks or clears bits, `^` toggles bits. Used with bit masks to manipulate flags.

**Q: How do you clear a specific bit in a bitmask?**  
A: Use `bitmask &= ~BIT_FLAG;` to forcefully turn off the bit.

**Q: When should you use macros vs `const` or `enum`?**  
A: Use macros for preprocessor control or platform-specific conditions. Prefer `const` or `enum class` for type safety in C++.

```
Initial:        0000 0000
+ATT_UP:        0000 0001
+DEF_UP:        0000 0011
+DEX_UP:        0000 0111
+SPEED_UP:      0000 1111
~SPEED_UP:      1111 0111 (Mask)
```
