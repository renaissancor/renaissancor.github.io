# Macroscopic View of Networks

### 1.1 Basic Network Structure

Networks are structured as **graphs** composed of:
- **Nodes** (vertices): Desktop computers, servers, smartphones, tablets, IoT devices, etc.
- **Edges** (links): Connections between nodes

```
    Visual: Network as a Graph
    
    [Desktop] --------- [Router] --------- [Server]
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
    [Laptop] ---------- [Switch] --------- [Printer]
                          |
                          |
                      [Smartphone]
```

Nodes can be categorized as:
- **Edge nodes**: End devices (computers, smartphones, etc.)
- **Intermediate nodes**: Network devices (routers, switches, etc.)

### 1.2 Network Components

#### Hosts
- End devices that generate or consume network traffic
- Can be categorized as:

```
    Visual: Client-Server Interaction
    
    Client                       Server
    ------                       ------
    [Browser]                    [Web Server]
        |                            |
        |------ Request: GET ------->|
        |                            |
        |<---- Response: HTML ------ |
```

- **Clients**: Requesting hosts (e.g., web browsers requesting webpages)
- **Servers**: Responding hosts (e.g., web servers providing content)
- Roles are not exclusive:
  - A device can act as both client and server
  - Function depends on the current operation

#### Network Devices
- Intermediate nodes that facilitate data transfer
- Examples: Ethernet hubs, switches, routers, Wi-Fi access points
- Primary function is to forward data through the network

```
    Visual: Network Devices
    
    [Host A] --- [Switch] --- [Host B]
                    |
                    |
    [Host C] --- [Router] --- [Internet]
                    |
                    |
    [Host D] --- [WiFi AP] --- [Mobile]
```

#### Edges (Links)
- Telecommunication methods connecting nodes
- Can be wired (Ethernet cables) or wireless (Wi-Fi)
- Link characteristics affect network performance

#### Messages
- Information transferred between nodes through edges
- Examples: Webpages, files, emails, etc.

### 1.3 Network Classifications

#### By Geographic Scope

```
    Visual: Network Types by Scope
    
    +----------+              +----------+
    |   LAN    |              |   LAN    |
    | (Office) |              |  (Home)  |
    +----------+              +----------+
         |                         |
         |                         |
    +----------+              +----------+
    |   MAN    |--------------|   WAN    |--------------- Internet
    |  (City)  |              | (Global) |
    +----------+              +----------+
         |
         |
    +----------+
    |   CAN    |
    | (Campus) |
    +----------+
```

- **LAN** (Local Area Network): Limited geographical area (home, office)
- **CAN** (Campus Area Network): Several buildings (school, company campus)
- **MAN** (Metropolitan Area Network): City or metropolitan area
- **WAN** (Wide Area Network): Broad geographical coverage

*Note: Internet is a WAN connecting multiple LANs*

#### By Message Exchange Method

1. **Circuit-Switched Networks**

```
    Visual: Circuit Switching
    
    [A] ------- [B] ------- [C]
     |           |           |
     |           |           |
    [D] ------- [E] ------- [F]
    
    Dedicated path A→B→C is reserved for the entire session
    Path D→E→F cannot use B→C even if available
```

   - Establishes dedicated connection before data transfer
   - Route is reserved for the entire communication session
   - Provides stable data transfer rates
   - Less efficient use of network resources

2. **Packet-Switched Networks**

```
    Visual: Packet Switching
    
    [A] ------- [B] ------- [C]
     |           |           |
     |           |           |
    [D] ------- [E] ------- [F]
    
    Packet 1: A→B→C
    Packet 2: A→D→E→F→C
    Packet 3: A→B→E→C
```

   - Divides messages into smaller units called packets
   - Each packet can take a different path to the destination
   - More efficient use of network resources
   - Modern internet uses packet switching

### 1.4 Packet Structure

```
    Visual: Packet Structure
    
    +--------+-------------------+--------+
    | Header |      Payload      | Trailer|
    +--------+-------------------+--------+
       |            |                |
       |            |                |
    Control      Actual           Error
    Info         Data            Checking
    (Address)
```

Packets are similar to parcels:
- **Payload**: Actual data being transferred
- **Header/Trailer**: Control information (addressing, error-checking)

#### Headers include:
- Addressing information (IP address, MAC address)
- Identifies sender and receiver
- Routing information

### 1.5 Transmission Methods

```
    Visual: Transmission Methods
    
    Unicast:        Broadcast:
    [S] → [R]       [S] → [R1]
                     ↓    ↓
                    [R2] [R3]
                  
    Multicast:      Anycast:
    [S] → [R1]      [S] → [Nearest R]
     ↓     
    [R2]   [R3]
```

- **Unicast**: One sender to one receiver (most common)
- **Broadcast**: One sender to all hosts in a network
- **Multicast**: One sender to a specific group of hosts
- **Anycast**: One sender to the nearest host in a specific group
