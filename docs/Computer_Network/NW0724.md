# Physical Layer & Data Link Layer 

Most modern LAN Cable follow Ethernet 

Physicsal Layer Ethernet Tech (Telecommunuication Method)

Data Link Layer Ethernet Tech (Ethernet Frame Format)

IEEE 802.3 Global Standard 
Coollection of Ethernet based several Standard 
or those working group makinag these ethernet related standards 
ieee802.org 

Standards about IEEE 802.3 expressed with alphabet like 802.3u, 802.3ab etc.. 

All physical and data link layer devices like hub switch NIC cable 
understand specific ethernet standard and based on those. 

There are countless Ethernet Communication standards, just remember that 
network devices, communication device types, and transfer speed 
might be different for each ethernet standards 

Communication Devices are named in this type of rules 
(Transfer Speed) BASE - (Additional Characteristics)

### Transfer Speed 

Simple Number means unit is (Mbps) while G means (Gbps)
For instance 100Base-T Cable supports 100Mbps speed, and 
10GBASE-T supports 10Gbps speed. 

BASE stands for (BASEband), modulation type. 
it is transfereing method of data that became bit signlal  by using communication device. 

Additional Characteristics include several types like 
maximum transfer distance 
enconding method in physical layor, how data get switched into bit signal 
rein num, paths to pass bit signals 
etc 

But most important characteristic is communication method type 
C - 동축 케이블 
T - Twisted Pair Cable 
S - 단파장 Fiber Optic Cable 
L - 장파장 Fiber Optic Cable

Ethernet contiues evolving 

- Fast Ethernet (100Mbps)
- Gigabit Ethernet (1Gbps)
- 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10Gbps)

Ethernet Frame 
Datalink Layer 
Ethern Network tranported frame sent by capsulation including 
upper layer information, header, and trailer. 

- Header - Preamble, receiver MAC, sneder MAC, Type / Length 
- Payload - Data 
- Trailer - FCS 

Would get received after decapsulation 

```
|<-----------------------Header----------------------->|<----Payload---->|<-Trailer->|
| Preamble | Receiver MAC | Sender MAC | Type / Length |       Data      |    FCS    |
| 8 Bytes  |    6 Bytes   |  6 Bytes   |  2 Bytes      | 46 ~ 1500 Bytes |  4 Bytes  |
```

Preamble 
First 7 Bytes are 10101010 
Last  7 Bytes are 10101011 

Exist to synchronize sender and receiver 

Receiver and Sender MAC Address 

- are called as physical address 
- Generally unique, mostly not changed. 
- MAC address is address assigned for each network interface, with 6 Bytes (48 Bits)

- LAN inside sender receiver specification 
- Generally NIC (Network Interface Controller) Device is in charge of Network interface 
- One Computer might have several MAC address. 

Check MAC Address of your PC 

Windows 
```shell
getmac /v  
ipconfig /all 
``` 

UNIX (Linux, MacOS)
```shell
ifconfig   
```

Type / Length 

If number is less than 1500 (0X05DC), it is frame size (length)
If number is more than 1536 (0X0600), it is type 

- Type, also called as ethertype 
- shows what information is encapsulated 
- For instance, upper level used protocol is included. 

|TYPE| Protocol |
|0800| IPv4     |
|86DD| IPv6     | 
|0806| ARP      |

DATA 

- Payload, upper level tranferred or should transfer contents 
- Max size 1500 Bytes 
- Min size 46 Bytes 

If smaller than 46 bytes size adjustment purpose data padding is filled mostly by 0 

FCS (Frame Check Sequence)

Error detection infrmation, 
FCS is a field to check whether error exists into received ethernet frame. 
This field has error detection value called as CRC(Cyclic Redundancy Check) 


NIC (Network Interface Controller)
Connect Host and Communication Methods, and check MAC Address assigned or not 

cable is physical layor lined communication method that is 
connected to NIC, including 

- Twisted Pair Cable 
- 광섬유 Cable 

NIC was Card in past, now sometimes in USB but mostly attached to motherboard. 

Host Network transferred info passes NIC 
so NIC work as network interface 

Also NIC can detect MAC Address, and abandon 
Sender MAC Address Frame that is not related 
Or use FCS field to detect error and abandon wrong frame 


Go to Ethernet Status in Windows Contro 
NIC has internet speed limit from 10Mbps to 100Gbps, 
network maximum speed is up to NIC 

### Cables 

Twisted Pair Cable 
made by Copper, send electric signal 

look like connector + cable itself. 

connector often used (RJ-45)
Cable, literally two copper lines twisted in pair, total 4 fairs 8 lines 

Copper is noise sensitive. 
So, it has shielding to surround copper line by either 
브레이드 쉴드 or 포일 쉴드 

Twisted Pair Cable classification for shield types 

- STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) surrounded by braid shield 
- FTP (Foil Twisted Pair) noise reduced by foil shield 
- UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) no shiled, only copper line 

Twisted Pair Cable classification for each shield 

XX|YTP 

X 

- U No shiled 
- S Braid Shield 
- F Foil Shield 

Y What shield for each twisted pair of copper line 

Fiber Optic Cable 

uses light to send and receive information 
compared to electricity based cable, fast speed and used in far distance 
Relatively much lower noise effected, so used in intercontinentical network connection 


## Network Devices 

Physical Layer, Hub 

Twisted Pair Cable 
Optic Fiber Cable 
Hub (CSMA/CD) 반이중 통신 

Data Link Layer  

NIC 
Switch (VLAN) 전이중 통신 


Physical Layer have no concept about address. 

Data Link Layer have concept about address, MAC address. 

Above Datalink Layer, detecting sender and  receiver MAC address is possible 

Hub Port Host etc 

Early Network connected several hosts by Hub 
Hub Characteristics 

1 Hub sends received data to all output ports 
No control, no judgement about information 
Just receive signal and send exactly same into all other ports 

In data link layer check packet MAC Address and destroy all address 
not related to the receiver PC 

2 Hub 반이중 통신 Half Duplex Mode 
One way road, 일방통행 

Full Duplex Mode 
Can send and receive at the same time 쌍방통행 
전화 Call 

Repeater, like Hub Physical Layer Device  
Electrical Signal reduced / distorted then 
amplify electrical signal to restore 

It is physical layer, so no judgement or control about signal, 
simply amplify signal. 

Hub includes repeater function


Hub Collision 
When one post sends data to hub, hub send that data to all except original sender. 
Half Duplex Mode 

So, when two hosts send data at the same time to hub then collsion happens. 

When more hosts are connected to hub then more likely for collision to happen 

This collision likelihood existing area is called as collision domain 
Every host connected in hub are belonged to same collision domain 

Thus, to reduce collision domain, reduce it as much as possible. 
How? 

1 Use Switch, restrict collision domain into one, removing any probability of collision 
2 OR use CSMA/CD protocol aka rule

CSMA/CD 
Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
First CS Carrier Sense 
Whether this communication method is possible to use or not. 
Is there any host sending data? 

Second, when collision happens, then detect Collision 
Stop transfer, send (jam signal) noticing collision happened. 
Wait for certain random period of time and resend it 
so, since two hosts that originally had collision will have each different 
random waiting time, so not likely to get collision again   

Half Duplex Mode collision preventio protocol 

### Switch  

Better than CSMA/CD, 
send acquired signal to port connected to receiver host, 
then connect by full duplex mode! 

Data Link Device, Switch will detect what MAC address, 
so can send frame to certain MAC address holding host. 
Supports Full Duplex Mode, so no need to use CSMA/CD 

L2 Switch - Data Link Layer used. Generally Switch is perceived as L2 Switch. 
Sometimes, L3 Switch or L4 Switch also exists, containing network layer or 
transport layer functions in Switch. But just Switch is L2 Switch 

1 Switch MAC Address learning function 
Send signal to only destination port 
Also collision domain reduces , unlikely to collide. 

VLAN (Virtual LAN)
Switch can separate Logical LAN into virtual LAN, VLAN. 

Switch MAC Address learning 
Remember certain port and host AMC Address connected to that port
Send frame to only target host 
MAC Address table contains relationship between 
Switch port connected host MAC Addresses and Port 


### how does Switch learn MAC Address 

1. 플러딩 
2. 포워딩 과 필터링 
3. 에이징 

Based on Sender MAC Address inside Frame

Switch MAC Address Table
based on sender MAC Addresses 
Switch assign port number and according MAC Address 
Inside MAC Address Table 

Flooding, similar to HUB, send frame to every port. 

Other hosts receive frame but if MAC Address of receiver is not them 
NIC will destroy frame 

So MAC Address table will register port number and MAC Address      


Bridge 
is also similar to Data Link Layer Switch. 
MAC Address learning forwarding, filtering, etc 
Bridge is less ued than Switch cuz Switch has more functions and better performance 

Bridge concept is often used although device is not used often. 

Switch VLAN Virtual LAN 
make virtual LAN by one Switch 
reduce inefficient traffic performance drop like flooding of hub switch 

If two groups share switch while not sharing workload 
it might be useless, so divide them by VLAN 
using one switch is several separated switch 


VLAN types 

1 Port based VLAN (more common) (Static VLAN)

Port 1 ~ 6  belonged to VLAN A 
Port 7 ~ 10 belonged to VLAN B

Like this, port hole based VLAN division

2 MAC Address based VLAN (Dynamic VLAN)

Already assigned MAC Address will define VLAN 

sending receiving frame inside, MAC address will define 
what VLAN would this host be included
