# Structs and Functions 

### Date: 2025-03-12

## Key Points

- Structs in C++ can include both variables and functions.
- `typedef` can simplify type declarations and increase readability.
- Structs can be nested to represent composite data.
- Functions modularize logic and support code reuse.
- Default function arguments simplify function calls.

## Overview

Structs in C and C++ allow the creation of user-defined data types. C++ enhances struct capabilities by allowing member functions. Structs are crucial for organizing related variables under a single composite type.

Functions in C++ help break down logic into reusable blocks. They support return types, parameters, and default arguments for flexible usage.

```cpp
// Simple struct with member variables
struct MyType {
    int I;
    float F;
};

// Nested struct example
struct NewType {
    MyType type;
    int Age;
    int Height;
};

// C-style struct with typedef
typedef struct Player {
    int MaxHP;
    int CurHP;
    int Att;
    int Def;
    int Dex;
    int Agi;
    int Int;
} PLAYER;
```

## Typedef and Aliasing

`typedef` simplifies complex type declarations. It helps improve readability and maintainability.

```cpp
typedef int INT;
typedef int SIZE;
typedef int TIME;

INT a = 0;
SIZE b = 0;
TIME c = 0;
```

You can also typedef structs:

```cpp
typedef struct Monster {
    int i;
    char c;
    short s;
} MONSTER;

Monster n = {};
MONSTER m = {};
```

## Code Demonstration: Struct Usage

```cpp
int main() {
    struct Player p;   // C-style declaration
    PLAYER p1;         // Typedef alias

    struct MyType t1;
    MyType t;

    t.I = 100;
    t.F = 1.1111f;

    int size = sizeof(MyType);  // size of the struct

    return 0;
}
```

---

## Functions in C++

Functions modularize code, allowing you to write logic once and reuse it. Default parameters provide flexibility for function calls.

```cpp
// Function with a default argument
int Add(int _a, int _b, int _c = 0) {
    int c = _a + _b;
    return c;
}

// Function with void return type
void TestFunc() {
    return;  // ends function execution early
}
```

Calling a function with fewer arguments uses the default:

```cpp
int main() {
    int Data = Add(10, 20);  // _c defaults to 0
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Tricky Case: Typedef Confusion

**Issue**: Mixing C-style and C++-style struct names can confuse beginners.

```cpp
typedef struct Monster {
    int i;
    char c;
    short s;
} MONSTER;

Monster n = {};  // Using the struct name
MONSTER m = {};  // Using the typedef alias
```

Both `Monster` and `MONSTER` refer to the same structure type, which can cause ambiguity in naming conventions.

## Interview Questions

**Q: What's the difference between `struct` in C and C++?**  
A: In C, `struct` only supports data members. In C++, structs can have functions, constructors, destructors, and access specifiers (default is public).

**Q: What is the use of `typedef` in C++?**  
A: It creates aliases for types, making code easier to read and manage, especially for complex types like structs or function pointers.

**Q: How do default arguments in functions work?**  
A: They allow omission of arguments during function calls. Defaults must be provided from right to left in the parameter list.

**Q: Can `typedef` be replaced in modern C++?**  
A: Yes, `using` is preferred in modern C++ for type aliasing.
