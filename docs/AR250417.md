symmetric structure 
if left is empty connect to left and design node as parent 
if not empty recursively move onto right 

enumerator 
enum 
struct class 
Creation of my own type 

enum MY_ENUM 
{
    TYPE_1, // 0
    TYPE_2, // 1 
    OTHER,  // 2
    OWNER,  // 3  
};

considered as 4 byte integer always. 

struct MyType
{
    int m_i; 
    float m_f; 
}

int main()
{

    MY_ENUM My = TYPE_1;
    My = TYPE_2; 

    return 0; 
}

Idle status 
Move status 
Attack status 
enum PLAYER_STATE 
{
    IDLE, 
    MOVE, 
    JUMP, 
    ATTACK, 
    HURT, 
    DEATH,
    FALL,  
}; 

int main()
{
    int iState = 0 ;
    iState = 1; // This case other people cannot understand current status 
    // Compiler enforce 
    Force casting possible 

    PLAYER_STATE PlayerState = (PLAYER_STATE) 220;

}

`enum` is used to save the state value 
Quite similar to MACROS #define PLAYER_IDLE 0 #define PLAYER_MOVE 1 etc ... 
In Macro, Preprocessed before compile 
enum is 4 bytes integer 
MAcro = Preprocessor, so considered as integer or similar before compile 

However, still macros are not possible to define something as type. 
enum STATE {enum1, enum2 } ... 
STATE state => this is impossible inside macros 

enums are checked DURING compile, so can only get input among listed inside enum declaration so type is enforced into specific digits 
Visual Studio shows both enum and its int value like Idle(0) Move(1) Jump(2) ... 

what happens inside nested enum? if name is duplicated ? 

MY_ENUM My = TYPE_1 // enum value names duplicated, one name in one enum, another same name in different enum number, crash 
Thus, highly recommended to use the state with more headers like for player statte, PS_IDLE PS_MOVE etc ... 
However, since it is not comfortable, enum class is called 

enum class NEW_ENUM
{
    TYPE_1, 
    TYPE_2, 
}

enum class 
NEW_ENUM 

enforce usage like class 
for instance
NEW_ENUM New_type = MY_ENUM::TYPE1 
OTHER_ENUM OtherType = OTHER_ENUM::TYPE2 

same name, but since class must be called to call enum no problem for duplication 
compiler recommend to use enum class instead of  enum 
maybe use static enum for more safety ? 

enumerated type enum 
BST + enum 

iterator implementation of the binary search tree 
In Order traversal iterator 

begin iterator
Start from root and go left until it reaches the end. it will be the smallest 
tBSTNode<T1, T2> * pBeginNode = m_Root;
if(!m_Root) return end();  
while(pBeginNode->arrPtr[LCHILD] != nullptr)
{
    pBeginNode = pBeginNode->arrPtr[LCHILD];
}

return iterator(this, pBeginNode); 

end iterator will be nullptr
{
    return iterator(this, nullptr); 
}
