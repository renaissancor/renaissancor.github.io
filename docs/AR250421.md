# Binary Search Tree Erase Logic

### Date: 2025-04-21

---

## Key Points

- `find` locates a node using binary search logic.
- Iterators traverse the BST in-order using `++` and `--` operators.
- `erase` supports deletion of:
  - Leaf nodes
  - Nodes with one child
  - Nodes with two children (replaced by inorder successor)

---

## Overview

This study note focuses on the implementation of `find`, iterator behavior, and the `erase` operation in a templated Binary Search Tree (BST). The BST manages memory explicitly, with pointer-based node structures and recursive logic for insertion and traversal.

---

## Find and Iterator Basics

```cpp
BST<int, int> bst;
bst.insert(MakePair(8, 0));
bst.insert(MakePair(4, 0));
bst.insert(MakePair(12, 0));

BST<int, int>::iterator iter = bst.find(8);
if (iter != bst.end()) {
    std::cout << (*iter).first << std::endl;
}
```

## `erase` Function Explanation

The `erase` function is responsible for removing a node from a Binary Search Tree (BST) while maintaining the tree’s structure. Let’s go through each scenario and corresponding code:

---

### **1. Precondition and Validation**
Before any deletion logic begins, the function checks that the iterator is valid:
```cpp
assert(_iter.m_Owner == this && _iter.m_Target != nullptr);
```
- **Explanation:**  
  This ensures that the iterator belongs to the current BST instance and that it points to a valid node. If either condition fails, the program will stop, preventing undefined behavior.

---

### **2. Deleting a Leaf Node (No Children)**
If the node is a leaf (i.e., it has no children), it’s the simplest case:
```cpp
if (_iter.m_Target->IsLeaf())
{
    pSuccessor = GetInorderSuccessor(_iter.m_Target);
    
    if (_iter.m_Target == m_Root)
    {
        m_Root = nullptr;
    }
    else
    {
        if (_iter.m_Target->IsLChild())
            _iter.m_Target->GetNode(PARENT)->arrPtr[LCHILD] = nullptr;
        else
            _iter.m_Target->GetNode(PARENT)->arrPtr[RCHILD] = nullptr;            
    }        

    delete _iter.m_Target;
    --m_Size;    
}
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - If the node is the root and has no children, the root pointer is simply set to `nullptr`.
  - If the node has a parent, the parent’s pointer to this node is cleared. The `IsLChild` check determines if the node is a left or right child and updates the appropriate pointer in the parent node.
  - Finally, the node’s memory is deallocated and the size of the BST is decremented.

---

### **3. Deleting a Node with One Child**
If the node has one child (either left or right), the child is promoted to the node’s position:
```cpp
else if (!_iter.m_Target->IsFull())
{
    pSuccessor = GetInorderSuccessor(_iter.m_Target);
    
    if (_iter.m_Target == m_Root)
    {
        if (_iter.m_Target->HasLChild())
            m_Root = _iter.m_Target->GetNode(LCHILD);
        else
            m_Root = _iter.m_Target->GetNode(RCHILD);
        m_Root->arrPtr[PARENT] = nullptr;
    }
    else
    {
        NODE_TYPE ChildType = _iter.m_Target->HasLChild() ? LCHILD : RCHILD;
        NODE_TYPE TargetType = _iter.m_Target->IsLChild() ? LCHILD : RCHILD;
        
        _iter.m_Target->GetNode(PARENT)->arrPtr[TargetType] = _iter.m_Target->GetNode(ChildType);
        _iter.m_Target->GetNode(ChildType)->arrPtr[PARENT] = _iter.m_Target->GetNode(PARENT);
    }
    
    delete _iter.m_Target;
    --m_Size;
}
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - If the node to be deleted is the root, the child simply becomes the new root.
  - If it is not the root, the parent’s pointer to the node is redirected to the node’s only child. The child’s parent pointer is updated to point to the node’s parent.
  - Memory is deallocated, and the size is reduced.

---

### **4. Deleting a Node with Two Children**
If the node has two children, it is more complex:
```cpp
else
{
    pSuccessor = GetInorderSuccessor(_iter.m_Target);
    _iter.m_Target->pair = pSuccessor->pair;
    
    iterator pNextIter(this, pSuccessor);
    erase(pNextIter);
    
    pSuccessor = _iter.m_Target;
}
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - **Find the inorder successor:**  
    The inorder successor is the smallest node in the node’s right subtree. This node will replace the current node’s data while maintaining the BST’s order.
  - **Copy data from successor:**  
    The successor’s key-value pair is copied to the current node.
  - **Recursive deletion:**  
    The successor is a simpler node to remove (usually a leaf or a node with one child), so the function calls `erase()` recursively on the successor.
  - **Update successor pointer:**  
    After the recursive call, the successor pointer is adjusted to point to the updated node.

---

### **5. Final Steps**
After the deletion logic, the iterator that was passed in is invalidated:
```cpp
_iter.m_Owner = nullptr;
_iter.m_Target = nullptr;
```
- **Explanation:**  
  This ensures that the caller cannot use the iterator to access the now-deleted node.

Finally, the function returns an iterator pointing to the successor node:
```cpp
return iterator(this, pSuccessor);
```
- **Explanation:**  
  This allows the caller to continue traversal seamlessly after deletion.

---

### Summary
- **Leaf Nodes:** Simply detach and delete.
- **Nodes with One Child:** Promote the child to the current node’s position.
- **Nodes with Two Children:** Replace data with inorder successor’s data, then recursively delete the successor.
- **Safety Checks:** Ensures the iterator is valid and prevents dangling references.

This detailed walkthrough should help clarify the logic behind each part of the `erase` function.

## Code Demonstration

```cpp
BST<int, int> bst;
bst.insert(MakePair(8, 0));
bst.insert(MakePair(4, 0));
bst.insert(MakePair(12, 0));
bst.insert(MakePair(2, 0));
bst.insert(MakePair(10, 0));

BST<int, int>::iterator iter = bst.find(8);
if (iter != bst.end()) {
    iter = bst.erase(iter);  // safely returns iterator to next valid node
}
```
