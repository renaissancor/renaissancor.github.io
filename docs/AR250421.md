rand value call 

srand value call 

based on different number value page value changes 
number srand 
10 

srand(time(nullptr)); // Time as Seed, Random Page Setup 
completely random ? Mathematically more complicated but anyway quite unpredictable 
day time second etc ... combined to make completely random number 

irandom[i] = rand(); 
If random number is setup between 1 and 100 then 
divide by 100 and do modular calculation 
(rand() % 100 + 1) >> returns 1 ~ 100 random numbers 
64 72 34 ... etc ... 
Since std::map ignore same number input it would automatically overlapping number
